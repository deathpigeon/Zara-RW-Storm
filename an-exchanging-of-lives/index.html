It knew the only way to survive was constant vigilance, both for danger and for food.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food, wondrous food, was the most important thing. You need to find the best food, delicious grain, and avoid bad food, poisoned pellets, fermented grain, poisonous leaves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danger was also important. Dogs that bark, cats that hiss, snakes that rattle, brambles that sting, hawks that dive. You needed your full wits about you to avoid them, which was always difficult when you need to look for food, eat good food, and watch the lines in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kúqr'rú scanned for good food. Yellow points on the ground caught its eyes and it fluttered down. Corn. Jackpot. It pecked at the grains of it, savoring every bite. The soft crunch of it, the sweet that filled its mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Woof woof!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kúqr'rú flapped its wings in panic. A large black dog with curly hair came bounding toward it, blocking its escape toward the gate, the overhang of the roof blocking off above.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Help! Help! Help!" Kúqr'rú cooed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pigeon tumbled out of the air toward the dog, aer wing bent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Begone, foul beast! You have met your match today with the valiant knight, Krjùkú." The newcomer fluttered in the face of the dog. "I am the protector of the innocent, vanquisher of the Úrù, blade of justice."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dog barked at Krjùkú and backed away and Kúqr'rú fled toward the gate of the house, flying up into the sky, following the line in the sky to the nearest glass cliff. It landed on a ridge and caught its breath, looking around for dangers and finding none.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far below, Krjùkú approached, listing to the side with aer wing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kúqr'rú cooed, "Up here."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krjùkú listed upwards, colliding with the glass of the cliff and landing on the concrete ledge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The maiden of the porch," Krjùkú cooed, "I hope you made it here unharmed!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I did, Krjùkú, was it? I thank you for your rescue."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What is the maiden's name?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Ah, my apologies," it cooed. "I'm Kúqr'rú. No fancy titles for me."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Well met, Kúqr'rú." Ae struts from side to side, lifting aer head. "You were an innocent maiden in danger, and I acted upon my duty."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Regardless, your actions saved my life. I was careless and missed the danger in my pursuit of good food."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Ah, food! The most noble of pursuits." Ae struts over to it. "If it pleases you, I would deign to serve as your protector so you may seek food in safety."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kúqr'rú hopped. "By the lines! I would love for you to. I always fear danger."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Then I shall protect you, fair maiden!" Krjùkú cooed. "Where shall we go questing first?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Oh, there's a place I want to go which I have feared because of the terror cat." It looked up. "The lines in the sky show the way."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lines crossed the sky, illuminating the directions of things, shining pathways to all the places in the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I have always struggled to follow the lines." Krjùkú stared up. "But I will trust you to know the way."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two took flight, travelling perpendicular to the lines. Kúqr'rú soared over the land and Krjùkú tumbled behind it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kúqr'rú circled a river as it lowered, landing at the banks. Krjùkú skidded against the bank of the beach.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I saw you needed rest with your damaged wing."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Thank you." Krjùkú strutted forward. "An old battle wound of mine."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"How did you get it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It was three long weeks ago," ae cooed. "I was flying gracefully through the street searching for a maiden to rescue when the great beast Úrù confronted me. It growled and rumbled, its hide shone bright, and its eyes practically glowed. It was a threat to all the maidens in the city and I knew I must vanquish it."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"And how did you vanquish the beast?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Of course! First I divebombed it," Krjùkú fluttered onto a rock. "I struck it with my wing, driving it back, and my pecks pierced its hard flesh. Soon enough, it was vanquished and fell to the ground. But, unfortunately, in the melee, my wing was damaged."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You're so amazing!" Kúqr'rú cooed. "I'm glad to be in the hands of such a powerful knight."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You are such!" Krjùkú strutted. "And what stories do you have for me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Hmm." Kúqr'rú cooed. "Well, in the city, my toe got wrapped up in a string. It hurt lots and, despite my best efforts, I couldn't get it off. In the end, my toe fell off."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kúqr'rú showed off its left foot, lacking the middle toe.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Oh! What a tragic tale." Krjùkú fluttered to the ground. "One as beautiful as you deserves not to be wounded so."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Oh, why, I mean, ah, thank you." Kúqr'rú hopped side to side. "You also are quite handsome."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krjùkú cooed, "You really think so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Of course. And your broken wing simply adds to your charm."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Thank you, fair maiden."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rest finished, the two of them took flight once more. Soon enough, they made it to the corn field. They circled down and landed on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"See?" Kúqr'rú cooed. "Lots of delicious corn!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"A true bounty!" Krjùkú cooed. "Thank you for taking me to this place!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two fluttered about pecking at the corn, sweet, juicy, fresh, succulent. Every bite filled them with energy and life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Mrowl!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cat leapt at Kúqr'rú and it fluttered its wings and Krjùkú took flight directly at the cat with a yell. It was in the air spiraling up and up and up, screaming, the cornfield far below.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Krjùkú wasn't with it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"No!" It yelled out circling above. It scanned the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It needed to find aer. It hadn't realized how much it had grown to care for the self-proclaimed knight. They had only been traveling together for a few hours, and it already never wanted to be separate from aer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Please be ok."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A flutter of wings. It gently circled down toward the Krjùkú. Ae limped forward toward some sweet smelling pellets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Ah," ae cooed, "a prize for my victory in combat."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those pellets... Kúqr'rú fluttered toward ae.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"No, stop!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ae had a pellet in aer mouth. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Please hear me," it cooed. "That's not safe."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krjùkú looked up and froze just for a moment. Ae spat the pellet out and then a few times more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Kúqr'rú!" ae cooed. "What is the danger?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"That's poison!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krjùkú stared down at the pellets then bowed to Kúqr'rú.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My life is in your debt," ae cooed. "Without you, I'd be dead."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Without you, so would I," Kúqr'rú cooed. "Let's call this even."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"No," Krjùkú cooed. "Lives don't work that way. One life does not trade for another for each life is unique. I owe you my life, not yours."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Then I owe you mine as well. And," Kúqr'rú cooed, "if you owe me your life and I owe you mine, then I guess we're stuck with each other for the rest of our lives."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krjùkú froze. "I would quite like that, I think. To live with a maiden such as you for the rest of my life."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Yeah, well," Kúqr'rú cooed, "I love you too. Now, let's go home."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, the two took off and flew back toward the city.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 2022, June 08</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/authors/zara-rw-storm/" class="invert" rel="author">Zara RW Storm</a></h3><p>If you like my work, please follow me on Twitter @deathpigeon or support me on Patreon. https://www.patreon.com/deathpigeon You can tip me with Cashapp or Venmo. https://cash.app/$deathpigeon https://venmo.com/Zara-Storm Pronouns are it/its.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/the-angel-and-the-creature/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> The Angel and the Creature</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii Static CMS</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
