The client, Akio, would look intimidating with his muscular build, harsh eyes, and pure black suit, if he hadn’t collapsed against Star as soon as they were alone.</p><p>They patted his back gently. “There, there.”</p><p>“I just miss him so much...” Akio’s voice trailed off.</p><p>“What can I do to help?”</p><p>Akio took some time to compose himself. He wiped the tears from his eyes and sat down in one of the chairs in his office.</p><p>“I just want to talk with Mścisław again...” He took a deep breath. “It’s been hard mourning him when his family didn’t even let me to attend his funeral, and it was all conducted under his deadname anyway.”</p><p>They nodded slowly. “I can see what I can do to contact him.”</p><p>Akio smiled, drawing the wrinkles on his face into sharper contrast. “I can afford to pay you whatever you want for this. I can afford it.”</p><p>Star pulled some candles, a lighter, and a meditation mat with sigils drawn on it out of their bag. They laid the mat on the floor and arranged the candles around them.</p><p>“I’ll be sitting on this mat in the middle of the sigils chanting his name,” they said.</p><p>“While I do that, I’d like you to light each of these candles counterclockwise. Can you do that for me?”</p><p>Akio nodded. They smiled at him and then settled onto the mat and closed their eyes.</p><p>“Mścisław. Mścisław. Mścisław.”</p><p>They heard the first candle get lit.</p><p>“Mścisław. Mścisław. Mścisław.”</p><p>The window curtains rustled.</p><p>“Mścisław. Mścisław. Mścisław.”</p><p>The door creaked open.</p><p>“Mścisław. Mścisław. Mścisł-”</p><p>They were Mścisław. They didn’t recognize their own body. They didn’t know how they were alive.</p><p>“Did it work?” Akio said. “Is that why you stopped chanting?”</p><p>Their eyes widened and they looked up at their husband. “Akio.”</p><p>They rose and embraced him. Akio squeezed them tight. They missed him so much.</p><p>They held there a few moments before speaking. “My family is being shitty about me, about us, aren’t they?”</p><p>Akio nodded. “They barred me from attending your funeral, and that took place after a few months of legal battles over who got to hold it.”</p><p>Mścisław winced. “I’m so sorry, love.”</p><p>They kissed Akio on his lips. They held there for several moments savoring the feeling.</p><p>“It’s been months since I died,” they said. “I’m curious, why today?”</p><p>Akio grinned. “Don’t you know? Today’s February 14th. Our anniversary.”</p><p>They laughed and kissed Akio again. “You were always better about remembering it than I was.”</p><p>“I know it isn’t much,” he said, “but I got take out from dad’s restaurant. I wanted to be able to share it with you.”</p><p>“I’m the luckiest man in the world,” they said. “Every other man must wish they had such a sweet husband.”</p><p>“I’m only so sweet because I have such a wonderful husband to be sweet to.”</p><hr><p>Take out boxes lay discarded on Akio’s desk, long since gone cold. Mścisław leaned against it, facing his husband, their mouth fixed in a smile, but Akio’s gaze was fixed on the ground.</p><p>“What’s wrong, love?”</p><p>“Tonight has been wonderful.” Akio looked up with tears in his eyes. “I’ve missed you desperately.”</p><p>Mścisław nodded and placed their hand on his chest. “I’ll always be here with you. Even if I can’t talk to you directly, I will live on in you.”</p><p>He pulled them in for a hug and they could hear him sobbing. They gave his body a squeeze.</p><p>They said, “I have one last request for my husband.”</p><p>“What...” Akio’s voice is hoarse. He pulls away from the hug. “What is the request?”</p><p>“Keep on living. You will love me forever, but I don’t want you to dwell on me, for my memory to haunt you.” They bit back tears. “I want you to be happy even when I’m not able to support you.”</p><p>He nodded slowly. “I can do that.”</p><p>“Good bye, my love.”</p><p>They kissed Akio one last time and he returned the kiss.</p><p>He pulled away. “I will always remember you.”</p><p>Once again, they were only Star.</p><hr><p class="align-center"><a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/ghost-crimes/">Read more Ghost Crimes.</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 2021, February 21</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/tag/ghost-crimes/">Ghost Crimes</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/authors/zara-rw-storm/" class="invert" rel="author">Zara RW Storm</a></h3><p>If you like my work, please follow me on Twitter @deathpigeon or support me on Patreon. https://www.patreon.com/deathpigeon You can tip me with Cashapp or Venmo. https://cash.app/$deathpigeon https://venmo.com/Zara-Storm Pronouns are vee/vem/veyr, xe/xem/xyr, or fae/faer/faer.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/ellesmere-eddas/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Ellesmere Eddas</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/the-fire-with-no-name-ghost-crimes-3/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> The Fire With No Name (Ghost Crimes #3) </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-06-01T09:21" class="feed__date">2021, June 01</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/unforgiven/" class="invert">Unforgiven (Ghost Crimes #4)</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-02-21T22:58" class="feed__date">2021, February 21</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/the-fire-with-no-name-ghost-crimes-3/" class="invert">The Fire With No Name (Ghost Crimes #3)</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-11-19T23:03" class="feed__date">2020, November 19</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/taken-to-the-grave-ghost-crimes-2/" class="invert">Taken To The Grave (Ghost Crimes #2)</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii Static CMS</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://deathpigeon.github.io/zara-rw-storm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
