<hr>
<p>Despite nearly half a year of experience as a medium, Star still didn’t know how to handle a sobbing client. The client, Akio, would look intimidating with his muscular build, harsh eyes, and pure black suit, if he hadn’t collapsed against Star as soon as they were alone.</p>
<p>They patted his back gently. “There, there.”</p>
<p>“I just miss him so much...” Akio’s voice trailed off.</p>
<p>“What can I do to help?”</p>
<p>Akio took some time to compose himself. He wiped the tears from his eyes and sat down in one of the chairs in his office.</p>
<p>“I just want to talk with Mścisław again...” He took a deep breath. “It’s been hard mourning him when his family didn’t even let me to attend his funeral, and it was all conducted under his deadname anyway.”</p>
<p>They nodded slowly. “I can see what I can do to contact him.”</p>
<p>Akio smiled, drawing the wrinkles on his face into sharper contrast. “I can afford to pay you whatever you want for this. I can afford it.”</p>
<p>Star pulled some candles, a lighter, and a meditation mat with sigils drawn on it out of their bag. They laid the mat on the floor and arranged the candles around them.</p>
<p>“I’ll be sitting on this mat in the middle of the sigils chanting his name,” they said.</p>
<p>“While I do that, I’d like you to light each of these candles counterclockwise. Can you do that for me?”</p>
<p>Akio nodded. They smiled at him and then settled onto the mat and closed their eyes.</p>
<p>“Mścisław. Mścisław. Mścisław.”</p>
<p>They heard the first candle get lit.</p>
<p>“Mścisław. Mścisław. Mścisław.”</p>
<p>The window curtains rustled.</p>
<p>“Mścisław. Mścisław. Mścisław.”</p>
<p>The door creaked open.</p>
<p>“Mścisław. Mścisław. Mścisł-”</p>
<p>They were Mścisław. They didn’t recognize their own body. They didn’t know how they were alive.</p>
<p>“Did it work?” Akio said. “Is that why you stopped chanting?”</p>
<p>Their eyes widened and they looked up at their husband. “Akio.”</p>
<p>They rose and embraced him. Akio squeezed them tight. They missed him so much.</p>
<p>They held there a few moments before speaking. “My family is being shitty about me, about us, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>Akio nodded. “They barred me from attending your funeral, and that took place after a few months of legal battles over who got to hold it.”</p>
<p>Mścisław winced. “I’m so sorry, love.”</p>
<p>They kissed Akio on his lips. They held there for several moments savoring the feeling.</p>
<p>“It’s been months since I died,” they said. “I’m curious, why today?”</p>
<p>Akio grinned. “Don’t you know? Today’s February 14th. Our anniversary.”</p>
<p>They laughed and kissed Akio again. “You were always better about remembering it than I was.”</p>
<p>“I know it isn’t much,” he said, “but I got take out from dad’s restaurant. I wanted to be able to share it with you.”</p>
<p>“I’m the luckiest man in the world,” they said. “Every other man must wish they had such a sweet husband.”</p>
<p>“I’m only so sweet because I have such a wonderful husband to be sweet to.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Take out boxes lay discarded on Akio’s desk, long since gone cold. Mścisław leaned against it, facing his husband, their mouth fixed in a smile, but Akio’s gaze was fixed on the ground.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, love?”</p>
<p>“Tonight has been wonderful.” Akio looked up with tears in his eyes. “I’ve missed you desperately.”</p>
<p>Mścisław nodded and placed their hand on his chest. “I’ll always be here with you. Even if I can’t talk to you directly, I will live on in you.”</p>
<p>He pulled them in for a hug and they could hear him sobbing. They gave his body a squeeze.</p>
<p>They said, “I have one last request for my husband.”</p>
<p>“What...” Akio’s voice is hoarse. He pulls away from the hug. “What is the request?”</p>
<p>“Keep on living. You will love me forever, but I don’t want you to dwell on me, for my memory to haunt you.” They bit back tears. “I want you to be happy even when I’m not able to support you.”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. “I can do that.”</p>
<p>“Good bye, my love.”</p>
<p>They kissed Akio one last time and he returned the kiss.</p>
<p>He pulled away. “I will always remember you.”</p>
<p>Once again, they were only Star.</p>

                <p>The following are poems about the divine Ellesmere written in the style of the Poetic Edda, that is using fornyrðislag verse. As such, they are each called "Edda"s. These are liable to later editing, more poems being added at a later time, and, perhaps, titles added at some point. For now, they're being shared as is.</p>
<p>Don't read these if you're not interested in learning about the described religious ideas and theology. This isn't something that's meant to be imposed on anyone, nor is there any expectation of adopting the religious beliefs endorsed by the poetry. These are means to share a particular religious perspective, not evangelical tools intent on conversion</p>
<p>In addition, Eddas 3 and 5 include sexual themes and Edda 3 includes allusions to violence. Feel free to skip it if such things bother you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Edda 1:</strong></p>
<p>Long ago there                                     were two great gods.<br>The Leviathan                                   <wbr>    Vastness of the World.<br>The Wanderer                                        Roamer of the World.</p>
<p>Encounter each other                          to discover love.<br>Mix together                                          to merge as one.<br>Magnetic pull                                         to form two poles.</p>
<p>Together become                                   great Ellesmere.<br>Named for the island                             of magnetic North.<br>The World’s gift to                                 the wanderers.<br>Means by which                                       we can orient.</p>
<p>Our god divine                                          oh great Ellesmere.<br>The love of two,                                        loving many.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Edda 2:</strong></p>
<p>When Ellesmere                                          first enjoined.<br>Vulnerability                 <wbr>                                left ver distressed.</p>
<p>Refuge was sought;                                    refuge was found.<br>In a fairy city                                                 sie was welcomed.<br>A city of refuge,                                           for rest and safety.</p>
<p>A Palace set into                                           an eternal rock.<br>Immense creation                                         of aged root.</p>
<p>The city protected                                         the singular couple.<br>Fae gave it love                                               and love it returned.<br>Bound the city                                                to divine Ellesmere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Edda 3:</strong></p>
<p>Before history began,                        <wbr>            the Wanderer; a hunting Beast.<br>Stalking ancient forests,                      <wbr>          a Beast of charting journeys.<br>Brush and great tree                          <wbr>             torn through forming paths.</p>
<p>An ancient fairy flees                                      its unerring direction.<br>Beast of food wanting and lust,                  prey of terror and desire.<br>Getting chase desired,                      <wbr>              flight is sought for.</p>
<p>The ritual of power,                                         the ritual of desire.<br>The prey always captured,                     <wbr>       and always consumed.<br>Back again for another                       <wbr>            hunt beneath gnarled wood.</p>
<p>In the ritual of the hunt,                                 the beginning of roads forged.<br>A gift to humanity,                     <wbr>                       ways to wander forth; to grow and prosper.</p>
<p>The fairy and the god,                          <wbr>             once companions of gory lust.<br>Separated over time,                         <wbr>                reunited in distant future.<br>A city giving love,                                                the fairy’s soul in its founding.<br>A fairy child among humanity,                  <wbr>      with stolen power; the fairy’s soul.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Edda 4:</strong></p>
<p>The serpent of the world,              <wbr>                great parent of the land.<br>The divine Leviathan                                       vastness in embodiment.<br>From hir springs fairies,               <wbr>                   creatures of the rolling hills.</p>
<p>Driven from the land,                  <wbr>                     hidden from the world’s vastness.<br>Dislocated from this god,                               no longer in zir embrace.</p>
<p>Petty squabbles;                                               <wbr>  petty kingdoms.<br>In absence of divinity,                                        in hiding underground.<br>Fairy kingdoms,                                                 <wbr>   fairy queens.</p>
<p>A plot of stolen power,                  <wbr>                     against the queen of winter.<br>A fairy child among humanity                           broken time; reaching back.<br>Stealing from the past,                                        taking royal power.</p>
<p>With power stolen,                                               a city forged.<br>Reunited with their god,                   <wbr>                  the vastness given love.<br>Worship once given,                     <wbr>                        worship now returned.<br>Division ended,                        <wbr>                            <wbr>   creatures with their divine.<br>Joyous reunion with their divine,              <wbr>        fairies lovingly embraced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Edda 5:</strong></p>
<p>Oh, divine Elesmere,                                           how you are love entire.<br>Oh, singular couple,                                            you are love encarnate.<br>The love of the Wanderer;                                the love of the Leviathan.<br>Embodied twicefold,                                          love of both in one.</p>
<p>For you love yourself,                                          you romance alone.<br>Here you play a game,                                        the body against the other.<br>You kiss and you fuck,                                        only yourself fooling around.<br>How you love and dance                                    in need of no other to love.</p>
<p>Oh, to behold your beauty                               it is the beauty of love.<br>To watch as you dance                                       your own dance partner.<br>As you love in yourself,                                     you love all who wander the world.</p>
<p>To love you back,                                                for all who behold your embrace must weep.<br>A love who loves;                                                 embodiment of loving itself.<br>In love, the pious must be                                with loving so pure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Edda 6:</strong></p>
<p>Two gods becoming one                               in glorious unity.<br>Even so, you must separate                         into the lovers who compose you.<br>Separation as sweet                                      as the singularity you always become again.</p>
<p>The Wanderer on hir paths,                        you cannot simply be tied to one.<br>The Leviathan in zer totality,                     you contain too much to only be one.</p>
<p>Your separation so temporary,                 yet important to the love entire.<br>The one must become two again             so you can become one again.<br>Separate you love                                          together you are love.<br>A beauty as both,                                          you beatify the loving.</p>
<p>Paths that cross the land,                          you love even separate.<br>Pious to each other,                                    worship of each other.</p>
<p>Your love consecrates                                the length of the globe.<br>Your love consecrates                                getting lost on your journeys.</p>
<p>Together again you always are               as love you have given form.</p>

                <p>An art trade with <a href="https://twitter.com/TheR3dPainter">@TheR3dPainter</a>.</p>
<p>An arrow flew past Alok’s face and he winced. A thunk behind him and another arrow notched in front of him. He leapt to the side and rolled coming up to a crouch, an arrow flying wide. Ahead of him one of the bandits fought Jespar with a sword, a wall between Alok and the archer. He didn’t have a good line of fire on the archer, not with Jespar in the way. Something needed to change.</p>
<p>He kept his distance and circled the fight to keep the archer in as much danger of hitting an ally as he was in. He was relying on Jespar to give him the opening he needed.</p>
<p>Jespar lunged forward. The bandit with a sword stepped to the side and moved in for Jespar. Alok realized the mistake he had made as he did as well. Jespar continued his forward momentum and shoved the bandit with his shoulder, knocking him off balance, then took several steps backward.</p>
<p>Jespar yelled, “Alok, now.”</p>
<p>Alok extended his hands forward and a bolt of lightning arced across the gap to the bandit. He gasped and fell. But the lightning didn’t stop. Alok focused on it to bring it to an end, but the magic kept flowing from him. The lightning leader searched for a new target. A bush sparked and a rabbit yelped, but neither maintained the bolt. Then it met with Jespar’s right arm who dropped one of his swords.</p>
<p>Jespar screamed in pain. Alok pulled on his hand, but it didn’t budge for a moment, and then the connection was broken. Smoke rose from Jespar’s arm. The archer stared at what happened, then turned and fled.</p>
<p>Alok rushed forward and knelt beside Jespar.</p>
<p>He reached out his hand. “Are you ok?”</p>
<p>Jespar flinched away and got up. “I’ll make camp.”</p>
<p>Jespar stalked off and Alok stared at his hands. He hadn’t meant to... Tears flowed unbidden. He sat there on the ground for several minutes before he could compose himself. He went to join Jespar at camp.</p>
<hr>
<p>A fire was lit in the camp by the time nightfall set. Jespar sat on a log, stoking the fire with a stick. He was using his left arm, not using his right arm. Alok approached the fire and sat by it, a short distance from Jespar.</p>
<p>“Do you...” Alok trailed off for a moment before continuing, “Do you want some help with your arm?”</p>
<p>Jespar stared at the fire in silence for several moments. “Yeah. That would be nice.”</p>
<p>Alok moved closer and examined the wound. The lightning had cauterized the hole it had dug into Jespar’s arm, but the blackness covering it was soot, not necrosis. It wasn’t good, but it would heal. He reached for Jespar’s sleeve, then stopped.</p>
<p>“May I?”</p>
<p>Jespar nodded and Alok pulled up the sleeve, careful not to touch the wound. He set some ointment and bandages out on the log.</p>
<p>“This is going to hurt a little.”<br>Jespar grimaced and his body tensed up. Carefully, Alok dabbed ointment on the wound. Jespar winced with each dab, but didn’t make any sounds. Alok rubbed more ointment onto the bandage itself then began wrapping it around his arm.</p>
<p>He paused the wrapping a second. “I’m sorry.” He continued wrapping. “I still don’t have full control over my magic, yet. But I would never want to hurt you.”</p>
<p>Jespar poked at the fire for a few moments. “Thank you. I don’t blame you for it. I guessed that’s what was the issue. It just hurts.”</p>
<p>Alok cut the bandage and tucked the end under the rest.</p>
<p>“I hope the ointment is helping with the pain.”</p>
<p>Jespar nodded slowly. “It is.”</p>
<p>Alok smiled. “I’m glad. I hate to see you in pain like this.”</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment and then kissed the outside of the bandage.</p>
<p>“A kiss to make it feel better.”</p>
<p>A slight blush entered Jespar’s face and he looked away.</p>
<p>“It’s feeling better already,” He said. “I can feel the magic working.”</p>
<p>Alok laughed and gently took Jespar’s hand is his own.</p>
<p>“There is a certain magic to that sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Jespar looked back at him. “What sort of thing?”</p>
<p>“To love, of course.” Alok grinned at Jespar. “There are few magics more powerful.”</p>
<p>They both stayed in place for a few moments, then Jespar kissed Alok on his forehead.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Jespar hesitated for a moment. “I love you too.”</p>
<p>Alok’s face flushed and he buried it against Jespar’s sleeve, bundled up against his shoulder. It was the first time he’d said that.</p>
<p>They sat there hand in hand with the fire for the rest of the night and fell asleep against each other, happy.</p>

<p>The stars twinkled far above the Earth. Since antiquity, humans stared up at them wondering if they stared back. Modern science assured them that the stars do not stare back. They sit light years away, burning balls of gas. Little did they know that they did watch. They watched as society developed from simple kings to complex slave societies, from feudal kingdoms to capitalist empires.</p>
<p>The Ek’en’ had long moved beyond what they saw on the planet. Wars between nations, genocides constructing those nations justifying billions exploited for profit by a ruling class. From their perch among the stars, they saw in the Earth their past of brutality, exploitation, and domination.</p>
<p>But Earth wasn’t content to stagnation. The planet rose up against their masters and tore apart their chains. Capitalism poisoned the water, polluted the air, and destroyed the forests. But the mass of workers tore it apart piece by piece. A new society, no longer organized around hierarchy and domination, but through free association of producers.</p>
<p>In the sky of this new world a shooting star fell. A round metal ball up close, with four wire legs trailing behind. This spaceship, the Ente’resh, housed three three long legged birds with impressive crests. Ned’era checked the engines, zar crest bright green. Akel’esh manned the controls, err crest golden. Ek’ibe’ paced furtively, its crest grey.</p>
<p>Akel’esh guided the ship through the atmosphere at a breakneck speed. Esh pulled back on a bar on the control panel with err clawed foot and the descent began to slow. Below, a city approached. Skyscrapers covered in plants, vines hanging down their sides, flowers blooming against them. Life overflowed.</p>
<p>On the ground, humans sauntered about talking with each other as they move around. The ship slowed as it approached the city, casting a shadow over the crowd. They stalled above the crowd and hovered there for a moment as the crowd parted to let them touch down.</p>
<p>Ek’ibe’ led the three of them out of the ship with a flutter of its wings.</p>
<p>“Greetings, humans.” It bowed respectfully. “I am Ek’ibe’ of the Ek’en’. These are my comrades Akel’esh and Ned’era. We have watched your people for a long time and I am proud to be able to finally meet you.”</p>
<p>The crowd stared. Whispers passed through the crowd. Finally, one human stepped forth.</p>
<p>“It is nice to meet you, Ek-uh-ibe-uh,” the human said, mangling the pronunciation of its name. “I am Sam. You can refer to me with xe/xem pronouns. It is nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>Xe bowed, mimicking the bow it had given the crowd, then extended a hand toward it. Ek’ibe’ took xyr hand and shook it. First contact between two free peoples.</p>

                <p class="align-center">Content Warning: Alcohol and Cigarette Use, Mild Police Violence, Police Intimidation, Police Interrogation, Parental Abuse, Ableism, Spirit Possession</p>
<hr>
<p>“Surely you can’t be suggesting that you can talk your way out of every spiritual situation,” Aaron said, his voice level. “Some spirits are hostile and need to be treated as such.”</p>
<p>Star sat at a wood slab table next to Aaron at Raised Spirits surrounded by the bar’s familiar hum of quiet conversation, not so loud as to overwhelm. Aaron was the spitting image of a Irish catholic priest: ginger hair, a wide grin, and a roman collar beneath his black shirt.</p>
<p>Star shook their head. “That’s not the point. It’s not about if the spirit will listen or is hostile. Sometimes a confrontation is inevitable, but, if you enter the situation with the assumption of that inevitability, then you’re ensuring its outcome.”</p>
<p>Star took a gulp of their drink. It went down smooth, tasting of raspberries. They hadn’t picked it themself, but had relied on Silvia, the bartender and their long time friend, to choose it for them.</p>
<p>“Star. Child. I am called in to situations where the spirit is already hostile. It isn’t an assumption that confrontation is inevitable. It is the situation I specialize in.”</p>
<p>“I understand, Father.” Star bowed their head momentarily. “But that a spirit is already hostile doesn’t mean they can’t be talked down. Your assumption is that the state the spirit is in upon your arrival is inherent to that spirit. Spirits aren’t any different from you or me. If you...”</p>
<p>Star stopped. The air grew cold. Not by much, but enough that Star was able to notice the change. The wind moved through the space as if by a mind of its own.</p>
<p>They thought, <i>No, not as if...</i></p>
<p>“Excuse me? Star?” Aaron’s voice broke through. “If I... what?”</p>
<p>Star leaned in to Aaron and whispered, “Something is here.”</p>
<p>The hairs on the back of their neck stood on end. A hand rested on their shoulder.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for the intrusion,” said a voice in their ear, “but I really must speak to the Father.”</p>
<p>They were Henri.</p>
<p>“Hello, Father Aaron.” Their head bowed deep for several seconds. “I would like to plead for your help in a matter I would only trust you in.”</p>
<p>Aaron stared at them. He downed the rest of his drink.</p>
<p>“How may I help you, child?”</p>
<p>“My grave has been robbed,” Henri said, “A priceless family heirloom has been taken. I fear that one of my children may be the culprit. I would like it back, but I do not want to see my family go to jail. Will you help me, Father? I do not know who else I can turn to.”</p>
<p>“Of course, child.” Aaron said, “I will do what I can to help you.”</p>
<p>They were Star, again. Henri hadn’t left. But he had stepped back.</p>
<p>Star said, “And I can help you too, Henri.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Father.” Henri said, “Thank you, shaman. We should depart from this place and visit the scene of the crime.”</p>
<p>The three of them got in Aaron’s car to go to the graveyard. The car ride was silent. It was dark outside and the only light was from cars around them. The light hurt their eyes. Sirens split the quiet. They were approaching the graveyard. Lights flashed red and blue. Aaron parked and the three of them exited the car.</p>
<p>Star grimaced. “Well, looks like we’re too late to beat the cops.”</p>
<p>“We can surely ask them what’s going on, child.”</p>
<p>Star rolled their eyes. Aaron shrugged and walked toward the cops alone. His mouth moved to speak, but he was too far for them to hear.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you scram?” A voice behind Star said, “This is a crime scene. We don’t need any of your crack pottery here.”</p>
<p>Star turned and blanched. The figure in front of them held herself like a hardboiled detective on the hunt. Her glower, her scowl, her tense shoulders, and her hand on her gun, all directed at them.</p>
<p>“Hi, Lisa,” they said. “It’s always so nice to see you.”</p>
<p>Lisa glared. “That’s Detective Lisa.”</p>
<p>“Well, Lisa, my ride is over there,” Star waved toward Aaron, “talking to the cops while you’re here harassing an innocent bystander.”</p>
<p>“You’re loitering by a crime scene.” Lisa grimaced. “And you’re a fraud. Sounds like you’re planning on swindling someone.”</p>
<p>Star said, “That’s hardly a fair-”</p>
<p>Lisa cut in. “Unless you’re here to help the thief. This sort of occult mumbo jumbo is your stock and trade.”</p>
<p>Lisa took a step toward them. They took several steps back.</p>
<p>Star rose their voice and said, “It’s not a great idea for a cop to harass someone with so many witnesses around. Especially not with a priest around.”</p>
<p>The cops and Aaron across the street turned to see what was going on. Aaron hurried across the street.</p>
<p>“Detective,” Aaron said, “What seems to be the problem here?”</p>
<p>Lisa waved her hand at Star. “We have a known charlatan here loitering by the crime scene. For all I know, they’re looking to help the thief.”</p>
<p>“Lisa, please,” Star said, “These accusations aren’t helping anything. Are you detaining me or am I free to go?”</p>
<p>Lisa turned back to Star and glared. “You aren’t free to go. In fact, you’re going to come with me to the precinct to answer a few questions. Face this car and put your hands against it where I can see them.”</p>
<p>They complied. Aaron stared. Lisa pulled their hands behind their back and cuffed them.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Star.” Aaron said, “I’ll get a lawyer to the station as soon as I can.”</p>
<p>Star smiled. “Thank you, friend.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Star’s hands were cuffed behind their back. The cuffs chaffed on their wrists, but didn’t do real damage. The back seat of the police car was hard plastic. There was no room for them to fit their hands. A beat cop drove them to the station.</p>
<p>They sat in the station waiting for their name to be called. Time crawled. Their name was called. Booking was mostly paperwork done by the cops.</p>
<p>They were led to small table in a small office store room, uncuffed, and left alone. Behind the shut door, a fan hummed, leaving the room running hot. The chair hurt their back, hard as concrete.</p>
<p>The door opened and a cop entered with a bottle of water. He towered over Star, but his posture was relaxed and his skin as dark as their own.</p>
<p>“Are you thirsty?” The cop said holding the bottle out.</p>
<p>Star nodded.</p>
<p>The cop smiled and sat next to Star. “Well, son...”</p>
<p>Star winced at that.</p>
<p>“I need to ask you some questions,” The cop continued. “You were there at the scene of the crime after all. Then I can give you some water.”</p>
<p>Star grimaced. “I’d like to speak to a lawyer.”</p>
<p>“A lawyer is coming. I’d just like to get you out of here as soon as possible, but I need you to answer my questions, first.”</p>
<p>Star stared down at the ground. They said nothing. Thirst overwhelmed their thoughts.</p>
<p><i>Maybe I should just talk. Get the water.</i> They thought. But that was a silly idea. Water and comfort weren’t worth jail time. And the cops wouldn’t accept that the ghost of the corpse in the looted grave asked for their help.</p>
<p>“I just want to know,” the cop said, “what brought you to that graveyard. I’m sure you had a very good reason for it.”</p>
<p>Star’s gaze wandered to the water in the cop’s hand. Their arm moved slightly toward it, but they stopped it.</p>
<p>The cop continued. “I know, I know. You give your clients confidentiality. I wouldn’t disrespect your professional pride by asking you to tell me anything private. But this is all off the record. Just a friendly chat. And you’d help me out a lot by just telling me what you can tell.”</p>
<p>Star’s voice cracked as they spoke, “Can I please have some water?”</p>
<p>The cop smiled. “I just need some information. I can give you some water, but I need something from you, first.”</p>
<p>Star shook their head. “It’s just very hot in this room. I can barely talk.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” the cop said, “I understand. The thermostat in here is always broken. But I don’t need you to do much talking. I can just ask you some simple yes or no questions and you can nod or shake your head.”</p>
<p>Star stared at the water. They thought, <i>It’s not much to just nod...</i> The offer was tempting. And their will was weakening. That was probably the point of the water and the heat. Not the faulty thermostat. The degradation of will.</p>
<p>The cop said, “Were you there on behalf of a client?”</p>
<p>Star stayed still.</p>
<p>“Were you called by the spirits of that place?”</p>
<p>Star trembled a bit from the thirst. They didn’t shake their head or nod.</p>
<p>“Ah, I understand,” The cop smiled. “You don’t think that I believe in spirits. It’s true that Detective Lisa is a bit of a hardass about that. But I have no reason to not believe you. My aunt could hear the spirits around her. She’d talk about it every Thanksgiving.”</p>
<p>Star couldn’t hold back coughing. The thirst hurt.</p>
<p>“I’m sure that whatever secrets the spirits have are yours alone, and I wouldn’t want to infringe upon that. I just would like to know-”</p>
<p>The door to this room opened. In stepped a tall man in a professional suit.</p>
<p>The newcomer said, “I’m sorry to interrupt you, officer, but my client doesn’t need to answer any of your questions.”</p>
<p>The cop shrugged. “It was worth a try.”</p>
<p>The newcomer turned to Star. “Hey, are you doing ok?”</p>
<p>Star shook their head, not trusting themself to speak.</p>
<p>“May I,” the lawyer said, “take my client somewhere more comfortable? Or are they charged with a crime?”</p>
<p>The cop sighed. “You are free to go.”</p>
<p>The newcomer, a lawyer, helped Star up and they walked out of the interrogation room. The lawyer signed off on some paperwork. They stopped by a vending machine and the lawyer bought them a soda which they drank thirstily. Then they left the precinct.</p>
<p>Aaron was waiting outside.</p>
<p>He nodded at the lawyer. “Thank you, Andrew.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a problem, Father.” The lawyer, Andrew, smiled. “I’m familiar with the detective in question. She’s a menace.”</p>
<p>“And how are you doing, child?” Aaron turned to Star. “Were you well treated?”</p>
<p>Star sighed. “The cop tried to be friendly, but he kept a bottle of water as leverage to get me to answer his questions. It was hot in that room.”</p>
<p>Andrew cut in. “Did you tell them anything?”</p>
<p>Star shook their head.</p>
<p>“Good,” Andrew said, “Talking with cops like that is just a liability.”</p>
<p>He handed Star a business card.</p>
<p>“If you ever get harassed by that detective again, please call me. I’m sure that Father Aaron would be happy to cover the costs.”</p>
<p>Star took the card. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Aaron and Andrew exchanged some words, then Andrew departed. Aaron offered to drive Star home. The drive happened in silence.</p>
<p>Star said good bye to Aaron at their apartment walked in and collapsed on their bed. They curled up into a ball and sobbed.</p>
<hr>
<p>Star woke up groggily.</p>
<p>“Are you ok?” Their friend Zee was sitting on their chest staring down at them.</p>
<p>In a crowd, they wouldn’t even notice Zee. Up close, they were able to study eir features. Eir eyes were a soft brown, pretty when studied. E scrunched up eir button nose and tightened eir thin lips into a slight frown.</p>
<p>They sighed. “Normal people don’t do this with eir friends.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not normal,” Zee said. “Plus, I was worried about you. You got arrested last night.”</p>
<p>“It was that detective who has it out for me,” Star said. “Aaron hired a lawyer and got me out. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Zee frowned down at them.</p>
<p>“Can you get off my chest?” Star waved em off. “I’d like to make some breakfast.”</p>
<p>Zee slid off. “I made you some eggs and coffee.”</p>
<p>E offered a hand to help Star up and they took it.</p>
<p>There were sunny side up eggs with some toast and coffee waiting for them in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Star said, “I don’t have eggs in the apartment. Or coffee this good.”</p>
<p>Zee slid off. “I made you some eggs and coffee.”</p>
<p>E offered a hand to help Star up and they took it.</p>
<p>Standing, they could take in eir whole body. A simple white tank top adorned eir beige binder and exposed muscles which they wouldn't have noticed from afar. Eir frame was slim while eir skin was smooth and well-maintained. Star’s stomach grumbled and they dug into the eggs.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I bought you groceries.” Zee smiled and sat on the kitchen counter. “You had a rough night, and I figured you’d appreciate the help. I know what you like.”</p>
<p>Star raised an eyebrow. “Bought?”</p>
<p>Zee splayed eir hands. “I can’t guarantee the money I bought them with was legally procured, but the groceries were bought with cash.”</p>
<p>Star laughed. They nearly choked on their eggs.</p>
<p>Zee frowned. “What?”</p>
<p>“I’m just imagining,” Star said, “you walking around a store like a normal person buying groceries.”</p>
<p>Zee giggled. “It’s true. I don’t do that very often. But, for you, I made a special exception.”</p>
<p>Star finished their eggs in silence. They took a drink of the coffee. Dark, but with a bit of whiskey mixed in. Perfect for a shitty morning.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Star said. “The food was delicious.”</p>
<p>Zee smiled. “It’s no problem.”</p>
<p>E patted the counter next to em. Star hopped up as well.</p>
<p>“So,” Zee said, “What got that detective to stick her nose in your business?”</p>
<p>Star grimaced. “Well, it’s more like I stuck my nose in her business. Not on purpose. My latest client is just... Related to one of her cases.”</p>
<p>Zee nodded. “The grave robbery.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Star said. “It’s... I was having a disagreement with Aaron last night about the nature of our respective work. And we were interrupted by the ghost of the inhabitant of that grave. He asked for Aaron’s help, but I’m a necessary go between.”</p>
<p>Star took a long drink of coffee. “He thinks someone in his family did it. He’d prefer for a catholic priest to convince whoever did it to return what was stolen than for them to get arrested.”</p>
<p>Zee nodded. “I understand. Do you need any help?”</p>
<p>Star drank more of the coffee. They stared down at it as it swirled. “Look into the father. I can’t help him unless I know more about him.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Zee said. “I’ll even do it pro bono.”</p>
<p>Star smiled. “Thank you, Zee. You’re a good friend.”</p>
<p>They sat there together on the counter. Star drank more of their coffee. Zee leaned against them, eir shoulder resting against their upper arm.</p>
<p>Someone whacked on the door, snapping their heads to it and then one another.</p>
<p>Zee ran to the back window. Star walked to the door, slowly. E gave them a salute before slipping out through the window. They opened the door.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Star.” Aaron smiled at them. “It’s nice to see you doing well. And are those eggs I smell?”</p>
<p>No one stood with Aaron visibly, but he wasn’t alone.</p>
<p>Star nodded. “Eggs for one, unfortunately.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s ok,” Aaron said. “I wouldn’t want to impose. How was your night?”</p>
<p>Star lowered their head. “It was rough. But this morning was better.”</p>
<p>Aaron raised his eyebrows. “You’re blushing. Someone was here this morning, then.”</p>
<p>Star’s hand went to their cheeks. They hadn’t realized they’d been blushing. They took a long drink of coffee.</p>
<p>“So,” They said, “do we have a plan for helping Henri? He came with you.”</p>
<p>Aaron nodded. “I set up a brunch with his daughter.”</p>
<p>“I did have breakfast,” Star said. “Should I really go to brunch, now?”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course, child.” Aaron smiled kindly. “You’re hungry far too often.”</p>
<p>Star quickly changed into fresh clothes. Nothing too fancy, but something serviceable. They chatted as the three of them walked down to Aaron’s car. They got in. Star held the door open long enough for Henri to enter with them.</p>
<p>They drove to a breakfast shop. Noise of overlapping conversation spilled over Star. They grimaced and took a deep breath before walking between the tables that littered the thin patio space outside. The smell of fresh coffee hit them as they entered and Aaron asked for the table with ‘Tatienne’.</p>
<p>An aroma of incense greeted when they got to the table. Tatienne stood stiffly. Her mouth was a thin line, frowning and a necklace rested against her chest. It showed a unicursal hexagon, a symbol associated with the occult religion Thelema.</p>
<p>Aaron extended his hand to her to shake. “Thank you for meeting us on such short notice.”</p>
<p>Tatienne accepted his hand. “It’s not a problem at all. Please, sit.”</p>
<p>She motioned for them to sit and they both did. She stared briefly at Star before returning to her seat.</p>
<p>“So, then,” Tatienne said, “what is it that a priest and a... Who are you, again?”</p>
<p>Star opened their mouth, but Aaron cut in.</p>
<p>“This is a colleague of mine,” he said. “They are consulting with me on a matter which requires their particular skill set.”</p>
<p>Tatienne raised an eyebrow. “And what is this matter that you are dealing with? You were quite vague on the phone.”</p>
<p>Aaron smiled. “An anonymous party requested that I look into the matter with your father’s grave.”</p>
<p>Tatienne’s eyes widened and her grip on her drink tightened.</p>
<p>“The man I spoke to,” Aaron continued, “is convinced that it was done by someone in a place of spiritual crisis. I am not a cop. I am a priest. It isn’t my job to seek retribution, but forgiveness for sin. So he asked that I intercede in the matter and convince whoever has stolen the item to return it before the police arrest them.”</p>
<p>Tatienne took a long deep breath and straightened her back. "So, what are they here for? I'm not sure what skills they might provide to your endeavor."</p>
<p>“I am here,” Star said, “to act as a point of contact for the party who asked for intercession and to act as a neutral party representing his interests. I have experience in matters like this and with clients like the one this case brings with it. Any action I take in this matter is to represent those who aren’t here to speak for themself, the client and any other relevant parties.”</p>
<p>Tatienne cocked her head. She nodded slowly. “In that case, I don’t know what help I could provide. I haven’t spoken to my father in years. My brother, Theo, is also in town. He might be able to help you more.”</p>
<p>Star said, “We haven’t even asked you anything, yet.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to,” She said. “I don’t have anything to give you. I’ll speak to the staff here and pay for your brunch, but I can’t help and I’m not interested in wasting my time.”</p>
<p>She got up and left.</p>
<p>“Well,” Aaron said, “she was eager to end this conversation before it began.”</p>
<p>Star sighed and stared at their lap. “What a perfectly useless meeting. I’m not even hungry for brunch.”</p>
<p>“Nor am I,” Aaron said. “Perhaps we should reconvene somewhere more private so we can discuss this with everyone involved?”</p>
<p>They left the store. Outside, the wind picked up slightly. Star felt a slight chill. They were Henri.</p>
<p>Henri sighed. “Tatienne has always been stubborn.”</p>
<p>Aaron raised an eyebrow. “Perhaps. But that’s a conversation for in the car.”</p>
<p>In the car, Aaron said, “What happened between the two of you?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” Henri said. “She got her stubbornness from me. And, when we are stubborn in divergent directions, that means there isn’t always a clear solution to the problem. It’s not relevant to any of this.”</p>
<p>Aaron frowned. “If you say so.”</p>
<p>“What of Theo?”</p>
<p>Aaron smiled. “Ah, Theo said that Tatienne might be like that on the phone. That’s why I scheduled her for brunch, and him for lunch in a few hours.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Henri smiled. “That sounds like Theo.”</p>
<p>They were Star, again. Henri flowed into the back seat of the car.</p>
<p>They said, “So what do we <i>do</i> until then?”</p>
<p>“We could go to church,” Aaron said. “Perhaps God can give us some guidance.”</p>
<p>Star glared at Aaron for a moment, then sighed.</p>
<p>Aaron smiled. “Don’t worry, child. I was joking.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Soft light greeted them when they entered the building. Paintings hung haphazardly on the wall and cheap white tablecloths covered the flimsy tables.</p>
<p>Star waved a hand in front of their face to try to get rid of the reek of sizzling steaks. “A steakhouse?” Star whispered. “Really? That’s where we’re meeting him?”</p>
<p>Aaron shrugged. “I didn’t choose the accommodations. I’m sure they’ll have <i>something</i> you can eat.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t even look like a particularly good steakhouse.”</p>
<p>“It’s a chain. But you should <i>see</i> the prices on this menu.”</p>
<p>Star said, “Gods. I don’t even want to know. It’s definitely too expensive for this place.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” A voice boomed behind them. “The priest and his assistant! So glad of you to join me!”</p>
<p>They turned. Behind them stood a tall man who reeked of cigars, bad cologne, and unearned superiority. He wore an expensive suit and a big grin on his face.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you, Theo,” Aaron said. “We spoke on the phone.”</p>
<p>Theo adjusted his tie, flashing his gold watch. “Come, we can go to my regular table, here. Lunch is on me.”</p>
<p>They sat with him. The restaurant was empty. The restaurant had just opened. Aaron explained why they were here, just like with Tatienne. Theo had no questions about Star.</p>
<p>“You want to know about my father?” Theo said. “So you can catch the thief. A real Sherlock Holmes and Watson.” He pointed to Aaron then Star.</p>
<p>Star nodded. “We want to know about his relationship to you and any other family who are in town.”</p>
<p>“First,” He said, “let’s order food.”</p>
<p>Theo flagged down a waitress.</p>
<p>He leered at her. “I’d like my regular, hon.”</p>
<p>Star grimaced and stared at their lap. Aaron glared at him.</p>
<p>“What?” Theo said. “I can’t play the field?”</p>
<p>Aaron ordered a simple fish filet. Star ordered a salad and some asparagus and a raspberry cosmo.</p>
<p>Food came. Theo got a steak with shrimp and a bottle of red wine.</p>
<p>Theo took a bite. “So, my dad,” he said, chewing, “He was great <i>to me.</i> He stood by me through my whole MBA, even when I got that drunk driving charge.”</p>
<p>Theo swallowed. He cut another piece of his steak off and put it in his mouth.</p>
<p>“That said,” he continued, “he was pretty shit to Tristan. He was my brother. Real schizo sort. Y’know. Hallucinations. Paranoia. The whole shebang. Good kid, tho. Dad didn’t treat him right.”</p>
<p>Star grimaced and poked at their salad. They didn’t like how he spoke about Tristan.</p>
<p>Theo drunk some of his wine, then took another bite. “If I’d be honest, I was kinda shit to him, too. He doesn’t speak to me, still. Not since he ran away from home. But Tatienne was close to him. She took dad’s treatment of him personally, for some reason.”</p>
<p>Aaron said, “So you think this has to do with the theft?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah,” Theo said. “The theft. Forgot about that. No clue who could’ve done it. But you talked to Tatienne, however briefly. Thought I’d fill you in on why she can be a bitch about this sometimes.”</p>
<p>They asked him more questions, but he didn’t have anything else to offer. Theo paid for their food and the two of them left.</p>
<p>“Henri?” Star said in the car. “Your son kinda sucks.”</p>
<p>The air in the car was perfectly still. No response.</p>
<p>Aaron said, “Would you like to go home, Star?”</p>
<p>Star nodded. He drove them to their apartment. They said goodbye and watched as Aaron drove off.</p>
<p>They turned toward their apartment and began walking. Out of the shadows stepped Lisa, her hand resting on her holstered gun.</p>
<p>She said, “Finished with your a hard day’s work scamming people?”</p>
<p>“Hi, Lisa.” Star sighed. “You know me better than to think I’d just talk to you like this.”</p>
<p>“I do know you,” she said. “But just because you won’t talk doesn’t mean there’s no reason for me to chat with you when you get home from... Who was it you saw? Ah, yes, two citizens who’s father’s grave was just robbed.”</p>
<p>Star’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Ah, you didn’t think I’d have someone follow you?” Lisa grinned, “You are one of my top suspects in that theft. I’m not going to let you out of the sight of law enforcement.”</p>
<p>“Hey, buzz off.” From the direction of their apartment stood Silvia like a guardian angel. She held herself with righteous confidence and her light brown skin glowed from the light of the streetlamps behind them. Her low cut top gave a lot for Star to stare at, but they lingered on her well built and hot muscles.</p>
<p>She said, “Go harass someone else so I can check in on my friend you arrested last night.”</p>
<p>Lisa turned slowly. She glared at Silvia for a minute. She returned the glare.</p>
<p>“Fine.” She turned and stalked off. “But I’m watching you.</p>
<p>They both waited for her to leave.</p>
<p>Silvia moved toward them and her arms moved slightly up. She hesitated then they dropped to her side.</p>
<p>She said, “Are you ok?”</p>
<p>Star nodded. “Yeah. Aaron helped me out and I had a good breakfast with a friend.”</p>
<p>They opened their door and Silvia followed. They sat on their bed and Silvia stood above them.</p>
<p>She said, “What happened?”</p>
<p>“I swear that detective has it in for me ,” Star said. “I was outside one of her crime scenes for a client and she arrested me. They interrogated me. I told them nothing. A lawyer Aaron hired intervened.”</p>
<p>Silvia nodded slowly. “That bitch.”</p>
<p>Star laughed. “Yeah, no kidding.”</p>
<p>They walked into their apartment and Silvia followed close behind.</p>
<p>She smiled at them. “So what was the client who brought you to her crime scene?”</p>
<p>Star filled her in on the case.</p>
<p>“The daughter is key to this,” Silvia said. “The son is a dick, but she dodged your questions.”</p>
<p>Star nodded. “She also didn’t bring up Tristan. Theo said that she was the only one who still talked to him.”</p>
<p>“But what does that have to do with what was stolen?” Silvia said. “That’s what I don’t get. We know about his family trouble. He was a dick to his son and is estranged from his daughter as a result. And his other son grew up to be a dick as well. Not a great father, overall. But that’s not <i>motive</i>.”</p>
<p>“Ah, well.” Star grinned. “That’s where my secret weapon comes in. Zee was here this morning and I asked em to check into this. I’m hoping that e can fill in the blanks left by this thoroughly frustrating family. Not sure when e’ll have the information, but I’m hoping it’ll be tonight. For now, we just need to wait.”</p>
<p>Silvia nods. “After all you’ve been through yesterday and today, what say you to a good dinner?”</p>
<p>Star shifted their face away from her, their cheeks flushed. “Yeah. That sounds good. Zee bought me groceries. Plenty to make”</p>
<p>Silvia grinned. “You rest up. I’ll be right on it.”</p>
<p>They flopped back on their bed.</p>
<p><i>If I knew getting arrested would have Zee and Silvia treating me this way,</i> Star thought, <i>I'd've gotten arrested earlier.</i></p>
<p>Oh, both of them were nice on good days. They were their best friends. Some of their only friends. Without them, they'd just have John, Aaron, and Ezra. But John was never around these days with his job. Aaron was a priest, so not exactly the best company. And Ezra was just a whole thing and they didn't talk to it on a daily basis. Besides, the power behind its magic often made dealing with it difficult.</p>
<p>But today they had been pampered. Zee bought them groceries and made them breakfast. And Silvia was in their apartment making them dinner.</p>
<p>They rolled over and buried their face in their pillow at the thought. They were a mess. Getting flustered over friends making them food.</p>
<p>Silvia’s voice cut in from above them. “Hey, Star. Food is ready.”</p>
<p>Silvia stood above them with two bowls. Star took one of the chili filled bowls and dug in. It was spicy and warm, a flavor they were used to since they were a teenager.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Silvia.”</p>
<p>“It’s no problem,” She said. “You’re in a rough place, so I’m helping. It’s what friends do.”</p>
<p>She was sitting next to them. They hadn’t noticed her sit down. She reached out a hand and gripped theirs in her own. She gave it a little squeeze. They smiled.</p>
<p>The front door opened. Zee stepped in.</p>
<p>“Hi, Silvia.” Zee grinned at the two of them. “Hi, Star.”</p>
<p>Her hand separated from theirs. They both got up.</p>
<p>“Hey, Zee.” Star smiled back at em. “I was hoping you’d come by tonight. What’ve you got?”</p>
<p>“First things first,” Zee said. “I smell chili.”</p>
<p>Silvia made em a bowl and all three sat back down on the bed, Star in between the two.</p>
<p>“The city records office has such lax security,” Zee said. “I could’ve walked in the front door and gotten anything I wanted, even sealed files. It was almost comically easy.”</p>
<p>Silvia grinned at em. “And what did you find?”</p>
<p>“Well, first, court files.” Zee pulled some files from eir messenger bag. “These show that Henri tried to get his son locked up in an asylum at 17 years old. Absolutely disgusting. It didn’t work and it sounds like he ran away from home after that. Good for him.”</p>
<p>Star frowned. “Tristan, right?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.” Zee nodded. “Furthermore, he had been cut out of the will. And this is where things get interesting. The will before he got cut out included some sort of pendant or locket or amulet or whatever. But it wasn’t transferred to someone else in the updated will. A supplementary document requests it be buried with him. If you want my opinion, that’s what was stolen.”</p>
<p>Star and Silvia grinned at each other. They said in unison, “Tristan did it.”</p>
<p>Zee laughed. “Exactly.”</p>
<p>Silvia said, “So, then, what do we do about it?”</p>
<p>Well, I do what I do best.” Star was grinning. “I make them talk to each other. We find someplace we can all meet. Bring Tristan, Tatienne, she’s his sister and on his side, Aaron, and Henri. We sit them all down and have a talk.”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s just one problem with that,” Zee said. “The tail that detective has on you.”</p>
<p>“I forgot about that.” Star grimaced. “Well, I’m not about to lead the cops to Tristan. So we need to lose them.”</p>
<p>The three of them talked it over and devised a plan.</p>
<p>Tonight, they'd contact Aaron to get him, Henri, and Tatienne to the meeting spot in Chessman Park. Zee picked it out. There were trees to hide among, a lot of exits, plenty of open space for them to see cops coming, and e knew a safehouse nearby.</p>
<p>Zee would call up eir contacts and see if e could get word out to Tristan about this. Tomorrow morning, they'd leave with Zee and lose their tail and Silvia would go about her day like normal and lose any tails she would get separately. Once their tail was sufficiently lost, they'd go to the park and they'd all talk it out.</p>
<p>They texted Aaron. <i>aaron. chessman park tmmrw. bring tatienne. </i><i>cn rslve evrthng. mke sure henri is wth u.</i></p>
<p>Zee was on eir burner phone with a contact speaking in hushed tones. The call wrapped up. Tristan was at one of the houseless encampments in town. Zee’s contacts could get em to the meeting.</p>
<p>Zee sat down on their bed. “So, then, what do we do all night?”</p>
<p>Star said, “Uh. Chat, I suppose?”</p>
<p>Zee and Silvia both nodded.</p>
<p>Silvia said, “Sounds like a plan.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Star woke to a sizzling sound.</p>
<p>They rubbed their eyes. “Zee?”</p>
<p>“Not just em,” Silvia said. “But e’s the one making breakfast.”</p>
<p>They yawned. “I’m not fully awake, yet. Don’t expect me to remember who all stayed the night.”</p>
<p>The three of them ate Zee’s eggs. They were eggs in a basket this morning.</p>
<p>Silvia left first. They listened as her motorcycle drove off. Zee rummaged through their clothes until e found what e was searching for.</p>
<p>E held up an old jacket with a tiger on the back. “Do you care about this?”</p>
<p>Star shook their head and Zee handed it to them. They put it on and headed out the front door.</p>
<p>They took the bus. Zee took them on a circuitous route. They passed through Union Station three times. Star could barely follow it.</p>
<p>They got out at Denver Metro University. There was a crowd of students walking to classes.</p>
<p>“Hold my hand,” Zee said. “We shouldn’t risk getting separated in the crowd.”</p>
<p>Star took it and the two of them melted into the crowd. They followed some students into the science building. Zee led them through the building to a lab.</p>
<p>Star whispered, “So what are we doing here?”</p>
<p>Zee pointed at a bucket. “Dump the jacket into the chemical waste disposal. People will assume someone got chemicals on it and destroy it. Then we can leave through a different exit and disappear into the crowd.”</p>
<p>They gave em side eye.</p>
<p>“What?” E said. “You said you didn’t care about the jacket.”</p>
<p>They shrugged and disposed of the jacket. They took eir hand, again, and the two of them walked away. They left through a different exit than they entered through. They boarded the bus several blocks away from the university. They sat in the back of the bus.</p>
<p>Star leaned in to Zee. “So that got rid of our tail?”</p>
<p>Zee nodded. “If they followed all that, then they deserve a promotion.”</p>
<p>They breathed out. Tension left their shoulders. “Thank you. I can rely on you for this sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Zee grinned. “That’s what friends are for.”</p>
<p>They reached the park in twenty minutes. Someone threw a frisbee on the other side, barely visible through the trees surrounding the park. No one else was there. They had arrived early.</p>
<hr>
<p>“So what do you think will happen?” Zee said. “Like, when Henri meets his son.”</p>
<p>Star shrugged. “I’m not trying to get him to do any singular particular thing. That’s not the point. Reconciliation, forgiveness, and repentance can only come from the wronged party and the person in the wrong.”</p>
<p>Zee nodded. “Right, I get that. I get you’re not trying to control their behavior. I’m not asking what you want to happen. But what do you predict?”</p>
<p>“Well. Uh...” Star stared at their feet for a moment. “I guess I hadn’t actually thought about that. Probably there will be some confusion and some yelling. But I’ll be here to try to keep things calm, and so will Aaron.”</p>
<p>“So why will it work now?” Zee said. “I mean, both of them have surely yelled at each other before. No doubt there were mediators as well. And that’s without adding graverobbery to the mix.”</p>
<p>“Well... I guess... Uh...” Star bit their lower lip. “I guess I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Zee shrugged. “It’s worth a shot. But you should at least think of that sort of thing before starting.”</p>
<p>Star nodded.</p>
<p>They stood there for awhile. Both leaned on the same tree. The wind passed through, sending a chill through the air for a moment. Star considered what Zee had said.</p>
<p><i>Surely you can't be suggesting that you can talk your way out of every spiritual situation.</i></p>
<p>They hadn't considered the implications to that at the time. Not really. They had told Aaron that he had missed their point, but, really, they had missed his point. They didn't need to stop trying. They didn't need to go into the situation assuming it would devolve into conflict. But they certainly needed to be prepared for that possibility.</p>
<p><i>And what happens when I can’t?</i> The thought hung over them and the situation. They might talk their way through this situation. And the next. And the next. But they’ll eventually find a situation where they can’t do that. When that happens, they needed to be prepared.</p>
<p>Zee nudged them gently. “Hey, Star.”</p>
<p>Silvia was resting against her motorcycle smoking a cigarette. They walked over.</p>
<p>Hey, Silvia,” they said. “Can I have one of those cigarettes?”</p>
<p>Silvia handed one over with a grin. They lit it up and leaned against the motorcycle as well.</p>
<p>Star took a long drag from their cigarette. “Do you think this will work?”</p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow. “What? You mean channeling Henri?”</p>
<p>They shook their head. “No. Getting them to talk. Do you think they’ll, y’know, see each others’ perspective? Listen at all to each other, even.”</p>
<p>Silvia shrugged. “It’s been awhile since I talked with my parents. Don’t know if a priest and a psychic taking me to a park and channeling the dead spirit of them would help things between us. But I’m not sure what choice we have and it’s a bit late for second guessing.”</p>
<p>Star nodded. Another drag from the cigarette. “I should have thought about that before making this plan. Not even that. Before taking on this case. I need to be more prepared for when situations fall apart, right?”</p>
<p>“Maybe you do,” Silvia said. “But, right now, you have more important things to worry about. Aaron is here.”</p>
<p>Star raised their head from their cigarette. Aaron’s car was pulling over. Three people got out of the car. Two men used the same door. They felt the second man more than they saw him. They waved the three of them over.</p>
<p>Tatienne said, “What am I doing here? I talked to you yesterday and the Father wasn’t clear about what I’m supposed to be coming here about.”</p>
<p>They grinned at her. “All will become clear when our final guest gets here.”</p>
<p>Tatienne began to protest, but Aaron pulled her to the side. Star didn’t object. They didn’t particularly want to deal with her. They leaned back against the motorcycle.</p>
<p>Except it wasn’t just the motorcycle there. Zee stood inches from their body.</p>
<p>E whispered, “He’s nearly here. He’ll be a bit down that way among the trees. Doesn’t know what all is going on.”</p>
<p>Star nodded. They raised their voice. “Hey, everyone. Our guest is here. Come with me.”</p>
<p>They turned and walked toward where Zee had indicated. Feet hit pavement behind them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t far before they saw a man moving his head jerkily at nothing in particular who they assumed was Tristan and a familiar figure who was like a goth who just left Hot Topic. It clasped its hands behind its head, accentuating its bleached white hair, and its grin showing its pearly white teeth.</p>
<p>“So, Zee,” Star said. “When you said you knew someone who could get him here, you meant Ezra?”</p>
<p>Zee ginned at them. “You said Tatienne seemed to be interested in Thelema, so I figured calling one of your occultist friends would work. And it did.”</p>
<p>They nodded and walked up to Tristan and Ezra.</p>
<p>“Hi, Tristan,” they said. “It’s very nice to meet you. Please don’t freak out.”</p>
<p>Tristan locked eyes with Ezra then Star then Tatienne behind them all.</p>
<p>He said, “Oh. This is about...”</p>
<p>“The special guest is Tristan?” Tatienne glared at Star. “What are you trying to pull here?”</p>
<p>Star smiled weakly at Tatienne. “You’re not going to like what I do next. Please don’t freak out.”</p>
<p>Voices overlapped with each other. They took a deep breath, counting in and out. The voices made the breathing difficult. But they pushed through it. In and out.</p>
<p>Their voice cut through the noise. “HENRI! HENRI! HENRI!”</p>
<p>They were Henri. They examined Tatienne and Tristan and frowned.</p>
<p>“Is this really a good time for me to be here, Father Aaron?”</p>
<p>Aaron shrugged. “This isn’t my plan, Henri.”</p>
<p>They nodded. “Well, if I’m to be here, I guess I should say hi to my kids.”</p>
<p>A laugh broke out. The person next to their son was laughing and grinning. It was Ezra. They knew that somehow.</p>
<p>“Star always knows how to make things so interesting,” Ezra said. “I’m glad I went along with this. That, Tristan, is your father’s spirit in my friend’s body.”</p>
<p>Tristan blinked at them. Then he glared and stepped forward.</p>
<p>A loud whack and pain consumed their jaw. They fell to the group.</p>
<p>Tristan glared down at them. “Hi, dad.”</p>
<p>Henri glared back up. “After all I did for you, this is how you-”</p>
<p>“All you did for him?” Tatienne yelled. “The fuck are you talking about, dad? Do you mean when you called the cops on your ‘psycho’ son? Or do you mean when you told him you were going to send him to an institution?”</p>
<p>They sat up. “Yes. I mean when I did my best to help my son deal with his madness by allowing the cops to help him with a crisis I was incapable of helping with and attempting to get him psychiatric care.”</p>
<p>Tristan stared off to the side at something they couldn’t see. He said, “I needed love and care. I didn’t need to be locked up. I’m not dangerous. The biggest dangers to me is how others treat me. Others like you.”</p>
<p>They stood up. “You were seeing things, talking to people. You were... You are sick.”</p>
<p>Father Aaron put a hand on their shoulder. “Henri. Is that really how you want to treat your son after so long of not seeing him?”</p>
<p>They glared back at him. “I should just take it when he punches me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you should,” he said. “Remember Luke 6:29. ‘If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.’ More so given he is your son.”</p>
<p>They frowned. “The Bible says a lot of nice things. But, if I’m to raise a son, I need to be able to do for him what he needs.”</p>
<p>“Son, I think what he needs,” Aaron said, “is for you to listen to him. We are all born fallible and it doesn’t do well to assume you know what’s best. Only God above does.”</p>
<p>They nodded. “I don’t know what’s best, Father. You’re right about that. But the doctors did and the doctors told me that he would improve in the facility, with the medication he would get there. I listened to them.”</p>
<p>They turned to face Tristan and stepped toward him. “And you, son, thought you knew better than the doctors. Your utter arrogance, enabled by your sister. You need to learn to listen to your father when he is doing what’s right for you.”</p>
<p>Tatienne glared at them. “Fuck off with that bullshit. You were doing what was convenient for your image, not what was best for Tristan.”</p>
<p>Henri said, “You always were very kind, Tatienne. But you never knew how to do what was needed.”</p>
<p>Tatienne’s face contorted. They didn’t hear what was said next. Their head was cloudy. Star opened their mouth. Henri closed it.</p>
<p>“Stay out of this, Star,” they said. “You wanted me to talk to my children, then you let me.”</p>
<p>Ezra cut through the yelling. “Old man. If Star wants their body back, you should let them have it.”</p>
<p>Its eyes locked with theirs. Pain shot through their body. They were Star.</p>
<p>“Henri,” Star said, “I didn’t bring you here so you could yell at your children. I brought you here so you could <i>listen</i> to them. Shut up and listen.”</p>
<p>They were Henri, again.</p>
<p>“Well, Star,” Henri said. “I appreciate your condescension, but these are my children. I will raise them as I wish and you will stop interfering.”</p>
<p>They felt the clouds in their head again. They turned their head away from Ezra and stepped toward his children.</p>
<p>“I am your father,” they said. “Everyone interfering has forgotten that. You are my responsibility, not theirs. I will take care of you and make what choices are necessary to raise you well.”</p>
<p>Tatienne glared at them. “Get back to me when you start making those choices, then. The only choices you’ve made have been to <i>control</i> us, not to raise us well.”</p>
<p>They stared down at Tristan. He was curled up on the ground with hands on his ears.</p>
<p>Henri pointed to him. “This is exactly what I was trying to fix by sending him to that hospital. He would’ve gotten the care he needed.”</p>
<p>Tatienne stepped forward. “Maybe if you didn’t yell at him his psychosis wouldn’t be-”</p>
<p>“Everyone shut up,” Zee said. Eir voice wasn’t particularly loud, but it pierced through the other voices. “All of your yelling has gotten the attention of the cops. And, if you don’t mind, we have a thief, his sister, and someone who was skulking around the scene of the crime, here.”</p>
<p>Everyone turned to stare.</p>
<p>“Now, I know I wasn’t followed,” Zee continued. “But I’m not so certain that the Father here wasn’t. The detective doubtless can put together what’s happening. We need to wrap this up and leave.”</p>
<p>Henri turned back and stared at Tristan. “<i>You</i> robbed my grave?”</p>
<p>Tristan raised his head. His face was stained with tears. “I-it was p-promised to me.”</p>
<p>“And, then,” they said, “you ran away. Did you expect that you wouldn’t be cut out of the will?”</p>
<p>Tristan grimaced. “It was promised to me. It was promised to me. It was promised to me.”</p>
<p>He started to cry again.</p>
<p>“You were <i>buried</i> with that?” Tatienne said. “What gave you the right to take that locket with you to your grave?”</p>
<p>“It was mine,” they said. “Surely I can make the decisions about it I deemed fit.”</p>
<p>Tatienne took a long, deep breath. “Maybe that’s the case, but does that make it right?”</p>
<p>They raised their chin. “It was mine, not his, never his.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, maybe not,” Silvia said. “But that doesn’t particularly matter, now. Fact is, he has it and either he goes to prison or you figure something out with him. We don’t have much time to spare.”</p>
<p>They stepped back from Tristan. “It’s true. I don’t think you should see the inside of a jail cell over this. It’s not for the cops to deal with. It’s a family matter.”</p>
<p>Henri took a deep breath in. They were Star.</p>
<p>They crouched down. “Hey, Tristan. I’m on your side with this. Your father really should’ve left this with you.”</p>
<p>Tristan slowly nodded. They reached out their hand and held it above his shoulder, not touching. He nodded again. They gently put their hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“I think you should get the locket,” they said. “It’s clearly important to you. But, right now, you need to avoid going to jail. The cops will be trying to find anyone who’s connected with your father to pin the blame on. If not you, then your sister might get the blame. Do you understand that?”</p>
<p>Tristan nodded to them.</p>
<p>Star smiled. “Aaron here can talk to your mother for you. Once this is wrapped up, the locket will go to her and she should be able to decide what’s done with it. The two of us can make sure you get it, like you want, and keep everything within the family, like your father wants. Does this sound ok to you?”</p>
<p>Tristan sat there doing nothing for a bit. Then he nodded.</p>
<p>They held out their free hand. “May I have the locket?”</p>
<p>Tristan rummage through their pocket and placed a plain silver locket in their hand. On the back was etched Tristan’s name and inside it was a picture of Tristan, much younger than he is now, on one side and an older woman who resembled Tatienne on the other side.</p>
<p>They gently closed their hand around it. “Thank you, Tristan. Me and Aaron can make sure this gets resolved.”</p>
<p>They felt something against their back. They were Henri.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Star,” Henri said. “But I can take it from here.”</p>
<p>They stood up and walked over to Aaron and handed over the locket.</p>
<p>“Tristan, Tatienne,” they said, “it will do us no good for the police to find us here.”</p>
<p>They reached down their hand to help Tristan up. He did nothing.</p>
<p>“Son. I know I hurt you.” They hesitated. “I can’t change that. But, right now, I need you to come with me so that Star’s effort isn’t in vain.”</p>
<p>He still did nothing.</p>
<p>They stared down at him, then sighed deeply. “I’m sorry, son. I shouldn’t have taken that with me to my grave. Now can you please come with me?”</p>
<p>Tristan hesitated. He took their hand and rose. They led Tristan away from the scene.</p>
<p>Ezra placed a hand on their shoulder. “Hey, old man. I know a place they can hide.”</p>
<p>They stared at it. “I would like to help my children get there.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure. Whatever,” Ezra said. “Just come with me.”</p>
<p>Ezra led the three of them away from the scene and down a side street. As they walked it explained that a friend knew some people who lived in the area which would work as a safe house while others dealt with the cops.</p>
<p>They didn’t take long before arriving at the house. Unlike the houses around it, this one was drab. The lawn wasn’t as neatly mowed. The facade wasn’t as well maintained. Ezra knocked on the door.</p>
<p>A young person answered. Henri wasn’t sure what to make of them. They were dressed eccentrically and wore strange make up.</p>
<p>“Hey, Erin,” Ezra said. “I’m a friend of Zee’s. E told you about me on the phone.”</p>
<p>Erin nodded. “E said we might need to give some people a place to stay for a bit. Cop involvement. But we’re always happy to do a favor for Zee.”</p>
<p>It nodded. “Yeah. Well, got some people here for you.”</p>
<p>They helped Tristan and Tatienne into the house.</p>
<p>“Henri,” Ezra said. “You should stay here with your kids. I need Star.”</p>
<p>Henri nodded. They were Star. The air moved around them into the house.</p>
<p>Ezra grabbed Star’s arm and dragged them further down the road.</p>
<p>“Hey, wait,” Star said. “Where are we going?”</p>
<p>Ezra glared at them. “To the meeting place Zee set up for us all. We’re going to wait for Aaron there and let our friends back there help those two. But, more importantly, we need to talk.”</p>
<p>They followed along and stared at the ground.</p>
<p>“Listen, Star,” it said. “You were useless against Henri back there controlling you. I intervened, once, but I can’t always be there and Henri figured out pretty quick how to avoid my <i>malocchio</i>, so you didn’t get control back until he let you. You need to fix that.”</p>
<p>Star nodded. “Sometimes I can’t just talk my way out of situations like that. I need to be prepared for the worst.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Ezra said. “You don’t like to throw your force around, but sometimes you need to be able to do so. And I can help with that. We’re friends.”</p>
<p>Star agreed and they made their way through the streets. They walked for more than an hour. Ezra didn’t check over its shoulder. They expected it didn’t need to. But they did. No one followed them.</p>
<p>Zee and Silvia were waiting up for them at a bench next to Silvia’s motorcycle. They greeted them with a hug from each. Aaron showed up not long after in his car.</p>
<p>“I talked to the cops,” Aaron said. “I told them I had been working to get the locket back for the family and cited ecclesiastical privilege. They were pissed, but I was able to call my lawyer and he got them to back off. I can talk to the family and make sure no charges get pressed. This will be a mess, but more trouble than its worth for the cops to keep pursuing.”</p>
<p>Star nodded and thanked him. They breathed a sigh of relief. They sat on the bench and leaned against Silvia. Zee sat next to them and leaned on them. Exhaustion washed over them. They closed their eyes and just let themself rest.</p>

<hr>
<p>Star knelt at the freshly dug earth. Death filled the space, but not as a physical feeling. There wasn’t some cold or smell or vibration that told them that someone dead was here. Instead, there was a gnawing sense of the inevitability of the end clawing at the back of their head.</p>
<p>They look up at their client, Lyuba. “I’m so sorry for your loss.”</p>
<p>She took a long drag from her cigarette. The lines on her face deepened. “Thank you. My poor baby Inna...” She covered her face as it convulsed slightly.</p>
<p>Star let the silence hang in the air. They knew her pain.</p>
<p>Her hand left her face and she was back to not showing them anything. “I miss her so much...”</p>
<p>Star nodded. “Before we start, I do need to know what you intend to do during the channeling. You will be speaking to Inna, but she’ll be in my body.”</p>
<p>Lyuba nodded slowly. “I just need to tell her I love her. Give her little scritches. Know that she still loves me.”</p>
<p>Star closed their eyes and concentrated on their breathing. Energy flowed along their skin like mud being pulled across the ground. It accumulated around their middle finger as a pressure on the outer joint, a slight tug on it from the small grave. They got up. The tug didn’t impede their movement, but it told them where the grave was. “We should probably go inside for this.”</p>
<p>Lyuba rented the back room of the house. The floor was strewn with clothes. Clothes that stunk. She didn’t have much in terms of furniture, only a bed and a dresser. But she had a cat tower and a lot of cat toys. She had clearly spent more money buying things for Inna than herself.</p>
<p>Star cleared a spot of dirty clothes and sat down crosslegged. “In just a moment I’m going to be channeling Inna into my body. This will still be my body and I can take control back at any time. But the spirit of your dead cat will be inside of me. She will remember everything from when she was alive and she’ll act like she did in life. Are you ready for that?”</p>
<p>Lyuba nodded. Star closed their eyes and began to control their breathing.</p>
<p>"Inna..." Star said. "Inna... Inna... Inna!"</p>
<p>The pressure around their middle finger thrummed. They pulled against it and the pressure let up, as if something had come loose.</p>
<p>They were Inna.</p>
<p>Their eyes opened and they looked around. They leaned forward and clawed at the ground, but their claws didn’t catch on it like they used to.</p>
<p>“Inna?”</p>
<p>The voice was soft. They were used to it booming. They looked up. She looked down at them with her soft grey eyes, crinkled from her smile. Their love overwhelmed them and they crawled up to her.</p>
<p>The soft voice spoke again. “Lyublyu tebe.”</p>
<p>Her arms wrapped around them. They felt their love returned.</p>
<p>They murred and rubbed their face against their mom. She gave them scritches on their head.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. If there was anything I could have done to help you...”</p>
<p>They didn’t know how they understood her, but they did. There was nothing that could’ve been done. In the end, they hadn’t wanted to keep going. Life had become too much and they didn’t want to continue.</p>
<p>Their face was wet and they didn’t understand why. They stayed there for awhile, their mother’s arms around them and water flowing down their cheeks.</p>
<p>Finally, their mother let go of them. Her voice came out strange. It was weak and cracked. “I would like to end this session.”</p>
<p>They were Star again.</p>
<p>Silence hung for several moments before they spoke. “She really loved you. I could feel what she felt, and there was an overwhelming feeling of love. You were her mother.”</p>
<p>Tears ran down Lyuba’s face. Her voice came out cracked when she finally spoke. “Did she blame me? For her death?”</p>
<p>Star shook their head. “It was her time to go. She’d lived a good life, but she couldn’t handle living too much longer.”</p>
<p>Lyuba nodded slowly. “Thank you.”</p>

<p class="align-center">Content Warning: Alcohol and Cigarette Use, Anti-Lesbian Violence, Domestic Violence, Death, Spirit Possession</p>
<hr>
<p>Books were strewn everywhere, like a small tornado had torn through the house. It was violent and destructive. Star had done a brief internet search before they’d come here, so they knew it was a haunted house. But this level of violence was unusual. No wonder they’d been hired.</p>
<p>They’d gotten the call first thing in the morning. The owner, Jessie, had sounded panicked. There had been a break in at her house and it was trashed. Before Star could object, Jessie clarified it was her haunted house. So they’d gotten breakfast, and headed right over.</p>
<p>“The lock was broken.” Jessie broke their line of thought. “That’s how I knew it was a break in. But, usually, break ins don’t cause all this.”</p>
<p>“I’m certainly no expert on break ins, but this does look like an angry spirit of some kinda.” Not that this was entirely accurate. Star wasn’t an expert on break ins, but they were friends with one. They’d talked with their friend about eir expertise enough to know what a break in looked like, and every part of this was sloppy. But this mess wasn’t that sloppiness. Certainly, the salt scattered on the ground wasn’t because of sloppiness.</p>
<p>She fidgeted with a pen in her hands. “I figured that was the case. That’s why I called a psychic, not the police.”</p>
<p>“I don’t feel the presence of a ghost in here. The house itself is alive with energy and thought, like all old buildings get, but nothing that could cause this.” Indeed, the house wouldn’t want to destroy itself this way. The structure of it would teach it to want to stay up and intact.</p>
<p>“The ghost is gone?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If I were to guess, that’s the doing of whoever broke in. An exorcism of some sort.” Star paused for dramatic effect. They didn’t like to be melodramatic, but a little bit of drama always helps sell a client. “This was ghost murder.”</p>
<p>Jessie stared at them in confusion. “Murder?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, there was a ghost living here. Now, it seems, the ghost is gone and there is evidence of a struggle. In addition, there’s salt scattered on the ground. I wouldn’t be surprised if there wasn’t also water and oil as well. The ghost was unmade by whoever broke into your house.”</p>
<p>Jessie nodded. “I suppose I didn’t think of exorcism like that, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Were you here when this happened?”</p>
<p>Jessie shook her head, “No, I live with my girlfriend. The haunting in this house makes it difficult to live in, but it’s a family house. We’ve had it for over a century, so I’m not about to give it up.”</p>
<p>That explained why she didn’t know this had happened until the day after. This would’ve been far too loud to miss if she’d been here. “What was the haunting like?”</p>
<p>Jessie fidgeted with her pen silently before speaking. “You won’t think I’m crazy, right?”</p>
<p>Star smiled. “No, of course not. This isn’t the first actually haunted house I’ve been to.” Reassuring clients was an important part of their job. Belief in magic and spirits was higher than it had been in decades, but public shaming of those experiences, things dismissively called the ‘supernatural’, persisted. Of course, none of it was supernatural. Spirits and magic were just as much a part of the natural world as anything else.</p>
<p>It took another minute for Jessie to get started, but, eventually, it all spilled out. “Things move in here. I’ve seen it. Without any wind or people. Books are taken off the shelves, chairs pushed out, doors opened. And there are… sounds that pervade the house. Laughing, talking, howls, crying. Sometimes I’d wake up and something had written things on my walls. It was intolerable to live in.”</p>
<p>They didn’t like the way people referred to spirits as things. They were as much people as anyone else. Star nodded. “Contrary to popular belief, ghosts aren’t immaterial. They have physical forms, just ephemeral ones. They form from the patterns of living creatures imprinted on the air and surroundings when someone dies. They can touch things, move things, anything a normal, living person would do. They certainly could move through doors without opening them, there are cracks, but they’re produced by someone who can’t, so some prefer to move through open doors.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate the lesson, but this is hardly the time,” Jessie said. Star liked explaining things. Spirits had long been a special interest of theirs. But she was right. Sometimes it wasn’t the time for that.</p>
<p>“Sorry. What I’m saying is that this sounds like a pretty typical haunting.” Star chewed on their words. “You never sold the building? Why’s that?”</p>
<p>“As I said, it’s a family house... But it was more than that, I guess. I never wanted to inflict the haunting on anyone else. And I don’t know what would happen if the building was torn down.”</p>
<p>“That’s sensible of you. But did anyone ever want it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. My...” She stopped herself. “My family was approached recently by a local brewery, the 18th Street Brewery. They wanted to open a new location, and they wanted our land.”</p>
<p>“Your family?”</p>
<p>“Me and my brother Luke. We don’t talk much. Our parents are no longer around and I’m the sole owner of the house, but he was included in the discussions. It is a family house.”</p>
<p>Star didn’t push the point. “Thank you for answering my questions. If you’d like, I could help you figure out who did this.”</p>
<p>“That would be appreciated. Thank you.” She paused a moment, then said, “How much would that cost?”</p>
<p>Star grinned and handed her a price list. “My usual rates apply.”</p>
<p>She examined it and nodded. “Thank you, Star. I’ll pay you when you can tell me what happened.”</p>
<p>They exchanged good byes and Star headed out.</p>
<hr>
<p>As they left the house, they put on headphones with music and began the walk to the nearest bus stop.</p>
<p><i>im gonna need to do work before lunch,</i> Star texted John. <i>might bleed into meeting you.</i></p>
<p>They’d planned on meeting with him for awhile, he was only in town for a few days before he had to head out, again. They hated to bring work with them. But sometimes it was necessary.</p>
<p>It took John a minute to reply. <em>lol. ur gonna do some smoke and mirrors on me?</em></p>
<p><i>its research for a client.</i></p>
<p><i>ah, a hot read.</i></p>
<p>They groaned. This was going to be a pain.</p>
<p><i>no,</i> Star texted, <i>this isn’t that sorta job, anyway. ill explain when you get there.</i></p>
<p>It didn’t take much longer for the bus to arrive. They got on, their thoughts trained on John.</p>
<p>He was one of their closest friends, family, really. When their parents had kicked them out in high school, he was the one who give them a place to live. But they hated how he treated their work. Just because he was skeptical of it doesn’t mean he had to be a dick about it. They weren’t going to miss out on lunch with their friend and they couldn’t put off work. But they weren’t sure how to pay rent without the money they’d make from this job, and money for food was tight. Their stomach grumbled at that. Their breakfast had been insubstantial. Quick and cheap. And John had agreed to pay for lunch... No. John was a friend, not a meal ticket. It’s not like the prospect of not having lunch didn’t factor into their decision to not cancel lunch, but…</p>
<p>The bus reached their stop at the 16th street mall and a lot of people got off. They checked their phone for the time. They were early. John wouldn't be here for another half hour.</p>
<p>They took their time on the walk. The bustle of the mall was distracting, but the fresh air would clear their head. Still, by the time they were to the Pavilion they were still upset. John had the ability to get under their skin like few others. They’d known him for longer than anyone else. Even their parents, technically. They hadn’t talked to them long enough.</p>
<p>They sat on a bench outside of the restaurant on the first floor of the Pavilion and pulled out their laptop from their grey messenger bag. It was cheap and barely functioning, but it’s not like they could afford anything more expensive, or even anything new.</p>
<p>They went to a Denver Post archival site. It was a useful tool for researching for clients. They searched for the address, but found nothing. A search for “haunted house” and the area got them a few short mentions of it as a haunted house. But nothing helpful.</p>
<p><i>It’s a family house, though,</i> Star thought.</p>
<p>They typed in their client’s last name. “Winthrop” brought them a few articles, but the most interesting one was from early in the archive. In the 1890s the wife of Eric Winthrop, a train magnate, went missing. Rumors speculated that he’d murdered her, but nothing substantiated that and the police didn’t investigate.</p>
<p>John arrived five minutes early.</p>
<p>Star smiled, but it was strained. They hurriedly put away their laptop. “I was doing some research as I was waiting.”</p>
<p>The two of them got a seat in the restaurant and put in their orders, a veggie burger with mushrooms and a cocktail for Star and a spicy burger and a soda for John. It was barely noon, but Star already wanted to get alcohol in themself.</p>
<p>John waited until their food arrived to finally ask, “So what’s the deal with your latest... client?”</p>
<p>“Someone broke into her haunted house and seems to have done an exorcism of some sort and she wants me to investigate it.”</p>
<p>John frowned. “So why doesn’t she call the police? If she can hire you, surely she’s able to turn to them for help?”</p>
<p>“Well, she thinks that, given the ghost stuff, someone who knows about ghosts would probably be pretty effective.”</p>
<p>John didn’t respond. The bustle of the restaurant dominated in absence of their conversation.</p>
<p>“Plus, she’s pretty clearly hiding something from me," Star said. "I’m willing to bet she doesn’t want the police to deal with whatever it is she’s hiding.”</p>
<p>“So you’re mixed up with some liar who’s rich enough to be able to call a psychic and crazy enough to believe it who’s hiding stuff and wants you to figure out who broke into her house?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Star. Are you sure about this? Like, I don’t generally like your work, but this sounds dangerous for you. And potentially illegal. I don’t want to see you get hurt over some lady with a ghost problem.”</p>
<p>“I can’t exactly turn down the paycheck... Plus the case seems interesting.”</p>
<p>“I can help you out with money. I make more than enough. And we’re basically family.”</p>
<p>They knew he meant that. They couldn’t rely upon anyone as much as they could him. But...</p>
<p><i>No!</i> They had relied upon John’s generosity far too much. It’s not like he was that much better off, especially since he was supporting his family on the reservation in Arizona. They grimaced and stared at their food. Their voice was quieter than before.</p>
<p>“I appreciate the offer, but I do prefer to pay my own bills.”</p>
<p>John sighed. “You’ve always been stubborn. So what’ve you found?”</p>
<p>Star smiled. John didn’t typically take an interest in their cases.</p>
<p>They filled him in on what they’d learned from Jessie and their initial research. They gave as much detail as they could remember.</p>
<p>“So, wait," John said, "what’s up with her brother?”</p>
<p>“What about him? She didn’t dwell much on him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly. You’re right that she seems to be hiding something. And whatever she’s hiding, she wouldn’t want to draw attention to. And she didn’t dwell on her brother. So he’s somehow wrapped up in this. Right?”</p>
<p>Star’s face heated and they took a long drink from their cocktail. That seemed obvious now. “I should contact the brother.”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly. I’m willing to bet she didn’t give you his number, but she might not refuse to give it to you if you asked. If she wants to avoid suspicion going his way, she wouldn’t go out of her way to prevent you from contacting him.”</p>
<p>“Hmm... I should text her. Hold up real quick.”</p>
<p>Star quickly sent her a text. <em>Hi, Jessie. Star, here. I want another perspective on the haunting from someone else who lived there. Would I be able to contact Luke?</em></p>
<p>“You should probably also look into that brewery," John said. "But I doubt I can help you on that. You’ve got other friends for that.”</p>
<p>Star and John both knew who he was talking about, but they didn’t want to mention em here in public. E liked eir privacy.</p>
<p>“Do you know the other friend’s number? I think it was changed, recently.”</p>
<p>E used burner phones and it could be difficult to keep track of eir current number.</p>
<p>John wrote a number down on the napkin and handed it to Star who pocketed it.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Neither of them had made much progress on their food, so they took a break from talking to just eat. Eventually the silence between them was unbearable and Star asked, “So how’s your boyfriend doing?”</span></p>
<p>John smiled. “Oh, Haruki’s out of town right now. His current job is a delivery to Salt Lake City. A beautiful drive. But we’ve been calling every night. I’ve never clicked with someone as well as I have with him.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’re dying to see him, again.”</p>
<p>“Yeah... I miss him a lot, not gonna lie.” John sighed wistfully. “So have you finally found anyone?”</p>
<p>Star grimaced. “I don’t know who I could find. It’s hard enough to find someone who accepts me as I am, let alone one who wants to be... Y’know...”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be so down on yourself, little sibling. You just need to put yourself out there.” He smiled kindly. “Play the field at Raised Spirits. You can always cry to Silvia if things don’t work out while you’re there.”</p>
<p>They weren’t sure they wanted to do that sort of thing around Silvia... But that line of thought wouldn’t be helpful. They finished their drink, feeling the need for its effects right now “I’ll consider it...”</p>
<p>John grinned at them. They weren’t sure he knew what he was doing with that suggestion.</p>
<p>“That you’ll consider it is all I could possibly ask of you,” he said.</p>
<p>John got their bill. Star didn’t want to know how much it had come up to and got up to go.</p>
<p>“I should probably head home," Star said at the door. "So I can call her brother in some amount of privacy.”</p>
<p>And so they could call their other friend without so many prying eyes.</p>
<p>“Of course.” John smiled at Star. “But do remember that you’re family and I love you a lot.”</p>
<p>The two of them embraced, then headed in opposite directions. John would be biking home and they’d be taking the bus.</p>
<hr>
<p>The walk from the restaurant to the bus stop was short, but they just missed the bus, so they had plenty of time to think as they waited.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t be able to call Zee until they got home. E wanted privacy for eir conversations, for understandable reasons. And Luke would have to wait, too. They needed to be careful with him. But there were people they could contact.</p>
<p><i>meet at Raised Spirits tonight?</i> Star texted Aaron. <i>need help with a job.</i></p>
<p>They didn’t have much else to do until they got home, so they paced and listened to their music until the bus arrived.</p>
<p>They were concerned about their conversation with John. He was concerned about them, they knew that. But they weren’t sure if they were even ready for a relationship, let alone prepared to put themself out there. Maybe he was right and they could stay late at Raised Spirits and see if anyone would like them. But hooking up with strangers after a conversation with a catholic priest wasn’t really their idea of a good time. Plus, Silvia would be there...</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">And he was also right that this job was risky to them. They needed Zee’s help, and they always paid Zee for eir work, but they weren’t sure they liked the prospect of getting arrested if e gets caught. And whoever broke into the house might be dangerous, too, and they weren’t exactly good for a fight. Maybe they should ask Silvia for help after they figure out who it is. For actually dealing with them.</span></p>
<p>They were also troubled by Jessie lying to them. They checked their texts for her and found that they had messaged her ten minutes ago.</p>
<p><i>Did you find the number?</i> Star messaged.</p>
<p><i>Yes.</i> Jessie texted back with his number.</p>
<p><i>Thank you. </i></p>
<p>She didn’t reply.</p>
<p><i>That’s out of the way, then,</i> Star thought. They could call Luke as soon as they got home. And...</p>
<p><i>I can meet,</i> Aaron replied. <i>6 PM.</i></p>
<p>gr8. c u thn.</p>
<p>The bus reached their stop and they got off. Their apartment block was right next to the stop and they were on the first floor.</p>
<p>Their apartment always felt empty. No roommates. Too small for more than one bed, anyway. They’d get a cat or something, but that was expensive, and their apartment block had a no pets policy. Some people kept pets anyway, but they couldn’t afford to be evicted.</p>
<p>Ok. Time to call Luke... But they could talk to Zee first... Talking to Luke was the scarier prospect. And they were still not feeling the best after their conversation with John. Maybe calling Zee would clear their mind.</p>
<p>They fumbled around in a drawer with a lot of junk, purposefully placed junk, and pulled out a beaten up flip phone. Zee had given them it for eir birthday as a “birthday present for emself”. Calling em with it would give them more privacy than without it, and they were supposed to regularly call some local businesses with it so that it seemed normal. Zee was a bit paranoid. They pulled out the napkin in their pocket and dial the number on it.</p>
<p>The phone rang exactly once. Zee picked up. “Yo, what’s up?”</p>
<p>“I need your help with a job," Star said. "I’ll pay.”</p>
<p>“You gonna be at Raised Spirits tonight?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m meeting Aaron there.”</p>
<p>“Right. Aaron. That’s why you’re going there.” Eir tone was light and airy.</p>
<p>They smiled. “Shut up. I need his help with the job, too.”</p>
<p>“You could always go to church.”</p>
<p>“And get burned by the holy water? I do witchcraft, after all.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I go to church all the time.”</p>
<p>Star laughed at that. “Yeah, but not on Sundays.”</p>
<p>There was a long pause. “Are you doing alright?” The levity had left eir voice.</p>
<p>They paused. “No, not really. Could you tell?”</p>
<p>“I can always tell when you’re upset.”</p>
<p>“I had a talk with John over lunch. He thinks I should put myself out there. Suggested I do it in Raised Spirits so that Silvia can comfort me if I get turned down.”</p>
<p>“Lol. You know he probably well knows how you feel...”</p>
<p>Star blinked. “I hadn’t considered.”</p>
<p>Zee laughed. “He’s trying to help you put yourself out there and he suggests there with her explicitly as the reason why”</p>
<p>“Right...”</p>
<p>“Anyway. Tonight. At Raised Spirits.”</p>
<p>Zee hung up without another word.</p>
<p>They lit the napkin with eir phone number on fire with their stove and let it burn out in the sink and redeposited the flip phone in the cluttered drawer.</p>
<p>Now they had to call Luke. They took a deep breath preparing themself. They dialed his number.</p>
<p>“Hello? Who is this?”</p>
<p>They nearly jumped. The phone had not rung very long</p>
<p>“Hello. My name is Star. I’m working with your sister on something and I needed to ask you some questions.” They used a professional tone.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure how I could help. I barely talk to my sister.”</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">“This isn’t about your sister. This is about your family’s house.”</span></p>
<p>“Oh. Yes. It’s ‘haunted’. I wanted to tear it down. But sis got it in the inheritance.”</p>
<p>Star raised their eyebrows. Was this what she’d been hiding? “I’m aware. Your family conflicts aren’t really my concern. What about the company which wanted to buy it up?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know much about that. I was only nominally included in discussions on the subject. Not that Jessie would listen to me.”</p>
<p>“And the haunting?”</p>
<p>“Is that what this is about? It’s silly. I believed it when we were kids, I guess, but that’s silly superstition.”</p>
<p>He was putting up a wall. They considered what else they could get out of this conversation, but concluded not much. “Thank you for answering my questions. Have a wonderful rest of your day.”</p>
<p>Both siblings were lying to them. Their stories clashed. Not majorly, but in details. Jessie had stopped short of saying some things, like that Luke wanted to tear the house down. They were certain that she nearly said that when she’d cut herself off. But they weren’t even sure if tearing down the house was Luke’s actual plan with it. They couldn’t trust a single word out of them. They’d get the information they need from Zee and that would be what they’d trust.</p>
<p>But it frustrated them. This would be easy to resolve if people just talked to them. Or if they could talk to the ghost that had been haunting the house. But that was off the table, too. Unless...</p>
<p>A theory formed. They’d have to ask Jessie about this when they next talked. Her ancestor’s wife mysteriously went missing with no investigations. Clearly, she’d died and her husband had covered it up. So why would he do that? Because he did it. There were, obviously, an innumerable reasons why he’d do this, but the most fruitful would be if she’d been cheating on him, this had angered him and he killed her. Which might mean that the lover’s ghost also remained. Especially if they died in the same event...</p>
<p>But they had nothing, yet, to prove that. They weren’t even sure if the siblings would know about it. It was family history, so they could, however... They needed to meet Jessie.</p>
<p><em>Can we meet tomorrow over breakfast? I have some things to ask you about.</em> They weren’t sure how long it would take her to respond and they had a lot of time before they had to meet up with Aaron. It was, they checked their clock, nearly 3. They needed to clear their head, then get ready to go to Raised Spirits.</p>
<p>They set up in the center of their apartment. It was a studio, so finding the center had been easy. They set up a mat they owned on which they’d inscribed various runes and alchemical symbols on. They liked to borrow from various traditions for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>The ritual power of symbols derived from their use, and existing symbols gave them the opportunity to tap into the power of pre-existing practices. But they didn’t have many traditions of their own to draw upon. The closest they had to religious practices related to their heritage would be christianity, which they wanted nothing to do with, or voodou, but no one in their family had practiced and they’d never felt much of a connection to it. So they made it up as they went along, inventing practices and syncretizing existing practices.</p>
<p>Star settled on the mat, closed their eyes, and counted as they breathed in and out. Energy flowed into them, like warm water in the air, and circulated throughout their body. Their heartbeat steadied. The air around them thrummed and sheathed them. They traced the symbols on the mat. They couldn’t see them, but they’d done this often enough that they didn’t need to. They drew ritual, magical, power out of them, and drew the power in. For a moment, it was overwhelming. Their body was supercharged with power. Then they let it all out, and their bad feelings went with it.</p>
<p>They opened their eyes. Meditating had a cleansing effect on them. They got up and rolled up the mat. They’d meditated for nearly half an hour. It had felt nowhere near that long. They still had plenty of time before tonight.</p>
<p>Still, they could get ready now. They always wanted to look good when they went to Raised Spirits, and they spent the day in sweat pants and a t-shirt. They’d gotten ready in a rush this morning. No one had commented, but they still wanted to look good.</p>
<p>It took them awhile to pick out the right clothes. They could fuss over them a lot. Eventually, they picked out a red button up shirt a relatively short black skirt and long red pants to go under it. They needed to shower, change into their clothes, then put on some make up.</p>
<p>The shower was short and functional. They shaved their face, put on the pants, then the skirt over. The red shirt was buttoned up only halfway. They didn’t apply much in the way of make up. They put on some foundation. It was difficult to find foundation as dark as their skin, but Silvia had helped them with that late last year, so they had plenty. And they applied some red lipstick, also a gift from Silvia. But they didn’t put on apply else. They were ready to leave.</p>
<hr>
<p>Star took the bus to Raised Spirits. They’d arrive early for their meeting with Aaron and they didn’t know when Zee would get there. They still weren’t sure of their theory about the two ghosts. At this point, it was just speculation and they didn’t know who the second one would be. Who would Laura have loved enough to face death? Or was that even it? Perhaps Eric had made a mistake, assumed something was happening when it wasn’t. They needed Jessie to tell them what she knew, if she knew anything. She had replied to them and set up the breakfast while they were waiting at the bus stop, so that would have to wait until tomorrow.</p>
<p>It was half an hour after 5 when they got to Raised Spirits. It had already been open for an hour. It wasn’t very busy, yet. It wasn’t a club. No loud music and it was well lit. It was the way Star liked it, quiet. They’d started coming here in high school with fake IDs. They’d met Silvia doing that well before she worked the bar. They’d gone to different schools, but had bonded instantly over underaged drinking and ghost stories.</p>
<p>That had been years ago. More than a decade. Now Silvia worked the bar and Star lived the ghost stories.</p>
<p>“My favorite customer.” Silvia smiled at their entrance and got to work making them a cocktail. She hadn’t asked them what they wanted to drink in years and just made them whatever she thought they’d like. Not that they were complaining.</p>
<p>“It’s always good to see you too, Silvia.” Star smiled back. “I’m here on business, unfortunately, I’m meeting Aaron in half an hour for information. And, if another friend happens to be here taking a smoke, I might pop out and have some boring conversations with em.”</p>
<p>Silvia slid over a drink. It tasted of blue raspberry, but smelled of her. “Always with the cloak and daggers with em.”</p>
<p>“Paranoia is what e breathes.” They’d met Zee through Silvia. She’d never explained how she’d met Zee, but they assumed it was something criminal. “Say... You might be able to help out, too.”</p>
<p>Silvia grinned. “I’ve got time to talk. Spill.”</p>
<p>“What’s the deal with the 18th Street Brewery? They’re trying to buy my client’s house, so more information on them would be good.”</p>
<p>Silvia’s lips purse. It was cute. “They’re well established. Founded awhile back. Their founder went on to do big things, but they’ve been getting a rise in business and need new locations. We sell their stuff here.”</p>
<p>“My client has a haunted house. Someone broke in and did an exorcism. I’m supposed to figure out who and why.” They paused a moment. “It’s a murder investigation. For the ghost.”</p>
<p>Silvia laughed. “That’s very you. I had heard they were trying to get a haunted house, but were backing off for some reason.”</p>
<p>Star blinked. “They’re backing off? Do you know why?”</p>
<p>“I heard that someone had given them bad advice.” She pondered a moment. “I suppose, if you’re going to go out and smoke, you’ll probably be able to get more about their internal workings than I could give you.”</p>
<p>Now was Star’s turn to laugh. “Yes, I suppose I will. Still, it helps to get multiple perspectives.”</p>
<p>“So what’s this murder investigation all about?”</p>
<p>Star explained to her everything they’d found so far. They even told her about their speculations. They loved telling her about their cases.</p>
<p>“The brother did it.” Silvia was matter of fact about it as if it were a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m thinking, but I’m not certain yet. That’s why I’m meeting with the client tomorrow. I need to know what happened to Laura.”</p>
<p>“If you need any back up, I’m off work tomorrow and you know I’m always willing to help you out.”</p>
<p>They took a deep drink for their drink. “Thanks, Silvia.”</p>
<p>“So how’s John doing? We haven’t talked in awhile.”</p>
<p>“Well, he’s got steady work. And he’s going steady with his current boyfriend. More serious than his previous ones.” Star sighed. “He hassled me about relationships. He thinks I should start putting myself out there.”</p>
<p>“He’s right, you know. Anyone would be lucky to meet you at a bar some time and go, ‘Hello, beautiful stranger.”</p>
<p>They took another drink to hid their blush.</p>
<p>“I could always find someone to set you up with,” she said.</p>
<p>“He suggested I try to find someone here. Something about how I could commiserate with you if I get shot down.”</p>
<p>She reached across the bar and patted their arm. Their heartbeat began to quicken, but they steadied it with their breathing. “I’m always down with commiserating with you.”</p>
<p>Another customer called for her and she was off. It was getting on to when Aaron would show up.</p>
<p>Someone whistled. Well, not ‘someone’. They recognized the whistle.</p>
<p>“Hey, Silvia," Star said, "Watch my drink for a bit. I need to get a smoke.”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>They went outside and pulled out two cigarettes from their shirt pocket. Zee would bring eir own, but they always liked giving em one regardless. A down payment.</p>
<p>Zee was crouched by the entrance to the store. E dressed to blend in, looking vague and non-threatening. E was small and slight, but that merely hid eir well developed muscles.</p>
<p>“You could go into the bar some time.” Star always gave em a hard time about this. They handed em the cigarette and they helped em light it again their own. It was a ritual the two of them had.</p>
<p>“Too many people,” Zee said. “I don’t like being seen. I call it sometimes to make my burner phones seem innocuous. I like talking with Silvia.”</p>
<p>“So do I.” Star smiled. They also liked talking with em. “Anyway, I need some help for a job.”</p>
<p>“Who do you want to know more about?”</p>
<p>“The 18th Street Brewery. They’re trying to buy my client’s house. Silvia says that they’ve been dealing with some bad information and might be backing down.”</p>
<p>Zee nodded. “I can get you information by tomorrow. I’ll wake you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Zee.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it. Really.”</p>
<p>Star grinned. The two of them shared the moment in silence. Star leaned against the wall while Zee stayed crouched beside them. Finally, the moment was broken by Zee standing. Star gave em a hand.</p>
<p>“It’s always nice to see you, Star.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice to see you, too.”</p>
<p>Zee put out eir cigarette then stepped out into the people walking down the sidewalk and disappeared into the crowd. Star sighed and returned to the bar.</p>
<p>“Hello, Star," said Aaron, who sat at the bar.</p>
<p>They hadn’t seen him enter while they were outside, but they were a bit preoccupied with Zee. He was a Catholic priest, but mostly he was a professional exorcist on the payroll of the Catholic Church. They hated his work and the Church, but they’d always gotten along with him personally and they were in similar lines of work.</p>
<p>“Good evening, Father.” They bowed their head respectfully, more for Aaron than for his position. “How’s the church?”</p>
<p>“It’s well. Many of the people who go there have been requiring my services, and I’m always happy to provide.”</p>
<p>They wrinkled their nose. His ‘services’ meant harm to spirits. He didn’t bother with meeting them on their own terms, only on his terms, and the spirits rarely survived. “Well, that’s what I’m here about.”</p>
<p>Aaron smiled “Surely not asking for my services. I know how you feel about what I do.” The two of them argued about how to deal with spirits from time to time.</p>
<p>“No. I need information. I client’s house was broken into and I saw signs of an exorcism.”</p>
<p>They explained to him the scene of the murder.</p>
<p>“Hmm...” Aaron considered his words carefully. “Now, Star, you know I can’t share with you anything divulged to me by my parishioners.”</p>
<p>They nodded.</p>
<p>“However... Without giving any personal information... A colleague of mine at a different church was approached by a young man asking about exorcism. He’d given that young man information how to do it, but had refused to do it himself because the ghost haunted a location that wasn’t the young man’s own possession. We’re priests. Breaking and entering isn’t exactly within our purview.”</p>
<p>Star considered that. “That sounds like who I’d be looking for... Mind if I run some theory’s by you?”</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>“The client has a brother. She was hesitant to talk about him. Lied by omission. And, when he talked to me, I’m certain he lied to me. But the one thing I believe him on is that he wanted the house and wanted to tear it down. He said that he didn’t believe in the ghosts anymore, but I don’t buy that. No reason to want to tear the house down, otherwise.”</p>
<p>Aaron nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“So it’s not the house he wants torn down. It’s the ghosts he wants gone. He can’t tear the house down, but, if he has the right information, he can break in and do an exorcism himself.”</p>
<p>“So far makes sense.”</p>
<p>“So he breaks in and does the exorcism. But the scene was fairly violent, so it was more than he was expecting. Which I think supports a theory I’ve had.”</p>
<p>Star paused for effect.</p>
<p>“Please," Aaron said, "do tell me.”</p>
<p>“You never let me be dramatic.”</p>
<p>Aaron smiled at them.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I think there’s two ghosts. The owner of the house centuries ago murdered his wife, I’m sure of it. But he doesn’t do so for no reason. He finds her cheating on him, or in a position where he interprets it as cheating, and murders her and her lover in a fit of jealousy, then covers it up after the fact. Which means there’s two ghosts.”</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">“But which ghost if either survived the exorcism?”</span></p>
<p>Aaron might be a priest, but he always had good contributions. Star grinned. “And can I get in contact with them.”</p>
<p>“You want to confront the brother.”</p>
<p>Star nodded. “I think letting the ghost speak to him will force him to consider a different perspective than the one that led to his... actions.”</p>
<p>Aaron smiled. “You’re doing priest work.”</p>
<p>Star nearly spit their drink laughing. “I would never dream of it.”</p>
<p>“I’m serious. Your relationship to ghosts and demons may be different from my own, but your position isn’t much. You’ve found a situation with troubled souls and you’re attempting to redeem the one who’s done harm. That’s precisely the work of a priest.”</p>
<p>Star thought about it somewhat. Finally they said, “Or of a shaman. Or a witch.”</p>
<p>Aaron nodded. “There are spiritual leaders in many faiths and, while we may disagree, all are able to do good work.”</p>
<p>“I thought you’d object more to the witch comment.”</p>
<p>Aaron laughed. “Child, the days of the Catholic Church killing witches is long past.”</p>
<p>They weren’t fans of the church, but Aaron had always treated them with respect. He’d never questioned Star’s identity nor pushed on them a change. They disagree on a lot, and surely on even that, but Aaron wasn’t the type to judge. Star nodded. “Thank you, Father.”</p>
<p>Aaron smiled. “I’m sure the information will be most helpful.”</p>
<p>“Not for that. For your reassurance. I wanted to object to your description of my work as ‘priest work’, but you’re not wrong. I appreciate the interreligious support, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Aaron nodded. “Think nothing of it. You have my support when you need it.”</p>
<p>After some silence, Aaron said, “Speaking of support, I can buy dinner. I know you struggle with money more than I.”</p>
<p>Aaron ordered a steak. Star ordered nachos. They ate in silence. Star appreciated the silence, and Aaron knew them well enough to give them that.</p>
<p>When they were done, they said their goodbyes and Aaron got up to leave. Star wasn’t sure if they should follow or not. Silvia answered that by coming over.</p>
<p>“How was your conversation with the priest?”</p>
<p>Star smiled. “It went really well. He gave me the information I needed, that someone matching the brother’s description, was asking around about exorcisms and helped me bounce ideas off of him.”</p>
<p>“The two of you have quite the odd friendship all things considered.”</p>
<p>Star giggled.</p>
<p>Silvia grinned “I’ll never get it. But I’m glad he can help.”</p>
<p>“You helped, too. I’ll need to make sure to call you tomorrow to ask for your help with the the thing I’m going to do tomorrow so you can help out.” Not their most eloquent sentences.</p>
<p>Silvia laughed. “You better! I don’t want to be left out.”</p>
<p>They said their goodbyes and Star got up to leave as she went to serve other customers. The bus ride home was quiet and lonely and Star spent it grinning. They got home and cleaned off their make up before collapsing in bed and falling asleep instantly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Star woke up with a start.</p>
<p>“You slept in your clothes from last night.” Zee was sitting on their chest looking down at them.</p>
<p>They groaned. “You could knock some time.”</p>
<p>“You were asleep and would not have answered the door. Plus this is more fun.” E dropped some files on the bed beside them. “I found the information you’re looking for. Indeed, a very interesting name came up when I was looking into the files. ‘Luke Winthrop’. Same last name as the person on the deed of the house they were looking to buy. He was fired last week. No reason was given, but I looked through their records and he had promised that he’d be able to get the house, but it wasn’t working. He said he could convince his sister. He couldn’t. That’s why they’re backing down.”</p>
<p>“Oh. This is very interesting, honestly. I just would appreciate it if you got off of me so I could get up and get some coffee.”</p>
<p>Zee sighed and slid off of them slowly and with more effort than it required. “So what’re you gonna do about Luke?”</p>
<p>They got up and headed to their kitchen to make some instant coffee. “I’m gonna confront him with this at the house. I need to know some more stuff from his sister, but I think I can get it arranged for tonight. I’m having breakfast with her.”</p>
<p>Zee grabbed the folder of papers. “Oh, in that case, I’m coming. I want to be there for your fabulous reveal.” Star opened their mouth to object, but Zee said, “I’ll waive my payment if you let me.”</p>
<p>“Ok, fine. You know I need the money.”</p>
<p>Zee smiled. “Sweet! I can’t wait to be involved in one of your ghost stories.” Zee came up to them and hugged them. “I’ll be at the house tonight. Don’t start without me.”</p>
<p>Star grinned and hugged em back. “I’ll make sure not to.”</p>
<p>Zee broke the hug after a bit, then fled the apartment without a goodbye.</p>
<p>They had more time to dress than yesterday, but they just put on jeans and a t-shirt. Jessie wouldn’t be expecting anything fancy after their sweatpants from yesterday. Finally, they were on the bus heading toward breakfast.</p>
<p>Jessie was waiting for them outside the restaurant and the two of them went in and got seated. Both of them had been here, before, so they were able to order quickly. Jessie got salmon and Star got Eggs New Orleans.</p>
<p>Jessie broke the silence waiting for the food to com. “So why did you need to meet up?”</p>
<p>“I need information that’s not publicly available which I hope you can help me with.” Star paused for her to ask and, when she doesn’t, continues, “Over a century ago, an Eric and Laura Winthrop, your ancestors, lived in that house. Laura went missing and there was never an investigation. I suspect that Eric murdered her and used his wealth to cover it up. I don’t know this for sure, but I was hoping you might.”</p>
<p>Jessie pursed her lips, hesitating. Time stretched and Star gave her time to answer. The server came with their food and put it there. Finally, she spoke. “It’s an old family story. About how the house became haunted. I’d hoped it wouldn’t be necessary to convey.”</p>
<p>Star nodded. “I understand. It’s unfortunately necessary. I need every detail about it you have.”</p>
<p>Jessie toyed with her salmon. “We used to be told about how Eric killed Laura and their maid when we were kids. It was a family secret. Something we weren’t allowed to tell anyone. A pathology, if you ask me. No one in the family has been immune, not even me. Laura had married Eric, but, so the story goes, she had only wanted him for the money and was plotting against him. It would probably be more accurate to say her family wanted the money. The marriage was arranged. And she was unhappy with the marriage.”</p>
<p>She stopped, chewing on her words.</p>
<p>Star waited patiently.</p>
<p>"Which brings us to the affair," she said. "We were told again and again that Eric treated her well so she never had a reason to cheat on him like that. But that probably didn’t matter. It was with one of their maids, Maria. She had worked for Eric for decades, longer than he was married to Laura. A ‘double betrayal’, we were told. Laura betrayed her husband and Maria her employer. He was enraged to discover the ‘betrayal’. Murdered them on the spot.</p>
<p>“But he still grieved them. Must be why he covered up their deaths.” Jessie’s face twisted into a pained smile. “So they were buried beneath the house. And they came back as ghosts from this burial. They haunted the house ever since. To remind us of what our family was built upon.”</p>
<p>She took a bite out of her salmon and looked distant. “It’s why I never told my parents about my girlfriend. Any situation that even reminds us vaguely of Laura is taboo in our family. My brother found out after they died. We’ve barely talked since. He’s stuck in the past.”</p>
<p>“Or the past is stuck in him," Star said. "We can’t escape the past. Even without ghosts. It sticks with us. Haunts us. We can move on, but we can never escape it.”</p>
<p>Jessie nodded. “I’ve tried. I moved out of the house. I lived my life my way. But its pathological for our family. I can’t move on by just moving away.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. We’re always stuck with the past. But we can change our relationship to the past.” They paused for effect. “Your family’s obsession was with Eric. With his pain. But they’ve never considered other perspectives in the past. You don’t need to run away from your family’s past, to try to escape it. Laura is as much your past as Eric is.”</p>
<p>Jessie slowly ate her salmon. She took a minute before she speaks again. “Thank you. I hadn’t considered that, really.”</p>
<p>“I need to ask you a favor to put this whole incident to a rest.”</p>
<p>Jessie smiled at the. “Anything you need.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to do a séance at the house tonight. Contact the dead. See what survived. But it’ll be tricky because of the exorcism. I’ll need both you and your brother there to help me channel her ghost. I can contact your brother for you if you don’t want to do it yourself.”</p>
<p>“No. I can get him there. I’ll set things up. When will this start?”</p>
<p>“We need to start around sundown. I’ll have two assistants there with me to help with my set up. You just need to be there with your brother.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’ll be there.” With that, they finished their meal in silence. Jessie paid. She offered them a ride back to their place and they refused.</p>
<p>Once she was gone, they called up Silvia. “I’ve got it set up for tonight. But I need to do something, first, and I’d like your help.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Silvia was already at Star’s apartment when they got there. She drove, they did not.</p>
<p>“What do you need to do so badly, Star?” She was dressed casually, but her tall figure was imposing. She worked out in her free time. A lot. Star was a fan.</p>
<p>“I’m going to channel a ghost and you’re going to convince her to come to the scene her girlfriend was murdered and confront the killer.” Star walked past her and opened the door. They motioned for Silvia to follow.</p>
<p>Despite that, Silvia stood there for a bit before she said, “You heard the whole story.”</p>
<p>“Yes. And I will get justice for the death. And I need help to do it.”</p>
<p>Silvia nodded and followed them inside. They pulled out their meditation mat and set it up in the center of their apartment as always, then went and grabbed some candles. Silvia helped set them up in a circle around the mat. Five candles for the five pointed star.</p>
<p>As they worked, Star explained to Silvia everything they’d figured out and the plan for that night.</p>
<p>“I want you to light these candles one at a time while I sit in the middle. Start with the one in front of me and go counterclockwise. With each one I want you to say, ‘Maria’. I’ll be chanting her name as you do it. Don’t stop when things gets weird."</p>
<p>They sat in the center and closed their eyes, controlling their breathing. They heard the lighter and began to chant.</p>
<p>"Maria. Maria. Maria. Maria."</p>
<p>The room grew cold.</p>
<p>"Maria. Maria. Maria. Maria."</p>
<p>The warmth on their skin from the window shifted.</p>
<p>"Maria. Maria. Maria. Maria."</p>
<p>They touched the runes on their mat. Energy was flowing into their apartment.</p>
<p>"Maria. Maria. Maria. Maria."</p>
<p>The final candle was lit.</p>
<p>"Maria. Maria. Maria. Mar-"</p>
<p>They were Maria.</p>
<p>“Where am I?”</p>
<p>It was their mouth that moved, but it wasn’t their voice that came out. Oh, it used their vocal chords, but the tone was off. Someone else spoke through their body.</p>
<p>Their eyes were open, staring around the apartment. A lady was there. She was tall and intimidating. But her eyes were kind.</p>
<p>“My friend can channel ghosts and spirits," she said. "They called you here for a conversation. They can’t talk to you while you in them, so you’ll need to talk to me.”</p>
<p>They looked down at their hands. It was odd. Their skin was dark. They’d always had this skin, but it looked new to them right then. Everything around them was new. “What do you need of a ghost?”</p>
<p>“Star, the person who’s body you inhabit, was hired by the house you inhabited. Someone had broken in and performed an exorcism. A murder. I’m sure you know about that,”</p>
<p>“It was that boy. Except he was all grown up. Time is funny. He broke in to the house. Hadn’t been there since he was a child. The exorcism was painful. We fought back.” All of a sudden, anger boiled in them. They nearly screamed. “He killed Laura. She had already died. Why did he need to kill her again?”</p>
<p>“Your story was a family sickness. Something they told themselves so often that it defined the way they saw the world. And he saw Laura in your sister. So he took out his anger on Laura herself.” The lady’s voice was kind. Comforting.</p>
<p>Tears rolled down their cheeks. Their head was in their hands. “It’s so unfair. We never wanted any of this to happen.”</p>
<p>“I know it’s unfair. But Star wants to give Laura justice. They’ll be a voice for you, for the past. So that the boy isn’t able to pretend like you don’t matter, pretend like your voice is irrelevant.”</p>
<p>They looked up and stared at the lady. “What do you need of me?”</p>
<p>“Tonight, Star will do this ritual again, but, this time, they want you to be there already so they don’t have to call out to you. They’ll give you a voice to talk to the boy. You will be allowed to speak.”</p>
<p>Tears welled up again. They sobbed openly. The lady’s hand rested on their shoulder. They leaned against her and she put her arm around them. Finally they were able to speak again. “No one has ever given me the chance to speak like this. Me and Laura. We were silenced by him. By the whole family. Treated as an embarrassment. I want to be able to speak.”</p>
<p>“You will get the chance to. You need to be at the house by sundown. Star will do the rest.”</p>
<p>They shivered. All of a sudden, they were Star again. Their head laid against Silvia’s side. Blush immediately plagued their face, but Silvia’s arm kept them there. “Silvia! I can’t break your grip.”</p>
<p>Silvia released them from her arm. “Oh. Star. Sorry.” She looked away, blushing slightly as well.</p>
<p>Star took a moment to gather themself, then blew out each candle in turn, moving clockwise starting with the last candle lit. They spoke. “That went well. I can count on you for tonight, right?”</p>
<p>Silvia nodded. “You’ll need a ride, if nothing else.”</p>
<p>Star smiled. “More importantly, I need someone to keep Luke from panicking and running away.”</p>
<p>Silvia laughed. “Oh. You need my muscles.”</p>
<p>“And Zee will be bringing eir information.”</p>
<p>“Let’s get ready for tonight, then.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The channeling had taken a long time, but it was still hours away from sundown. Enough time for them to get ready. Silvia had come to the apartment on her motorcycle and she offered to give them a ride. She lent them her spare helmet and mounted the motorcycle, then they mounted behind her and gripped her around her waist. This wasn’t their first time riding with Silvia.</p>
<p>They grabbed some food first off, cheap fast food they gorged on, then picked up some extra candles. Star owned some, but not enough for tonight’s ritual. They got some extra chalk while they were at it. Finally, they stopped by Silvia’s apartment for her to get a telescopic baton she kept for self-defense. “Just in case.”</p>
<p>Silvia’s apartment was a nicer place than Star’s, but not by much. She had a separated bedroom and it was maintained better, but she hardly lived in a luxury apartment. It was getting late. They had enough time to get there before sundown, so they could stop to relax.</p>
<p>“Want a smoke?” Silvia held out a cigarette.</p>
<p>“Gods. I’ve been needing one all day.” Star happily took it and Silvia lit it for them before lighting her own. They took a long drag, blowing out cluttered thoughts with the smoke, clearing their mind. It was nice.</p>
<p>Star and Silvia stood side by side leaning against Silvia’s balcony. Star liked it when the two of them just shared a space in silence. Her presence put their mind at ease as much as the cigarette did.</p>
<p>“You know,” Silvia said, “when you told me those ghost stories when we were kids, I never imagined they were real.”</p>
<p>“Well, I wasn’t sure I believed them, either. I could see things, sure, but no one ever listened to me, until I met you.”</p>
<p>“I guess I wanted them to be real. For there to be more in this world than what I was told. I had people telling me the world was cold, inert, and lifeless. That we were alone in an empty universe. And I had other people telling me that the world was God’s kingdom. That our immortal soul was at stake in our every action and we’ll be judged in the end of times when the dead walk.” She took a long drag from her cigarette. “You were the first person who showed me a world alive with spirits, but where we could escape from God’s judgment.”</p>
<p>Star nodded. “God isn’t who judges us. It is other people in this world.”</p>
<p>“So what does that make you, then? You come into this story after the fact. Not even after the body is dead, but after their ghost was killed, too. Are you taking on the role of the judging God I learned about in church?” Her tone was light, just chatting, not arguing. But it had an edge to it.</p>
<p>Star shook their head.</p>
<p>“No," they said. "I’m not here to judge anyone. I don’t want to mete out punishment or pronounce innocence or guilt. I’m not a cop, a judge, a jury, or a prison warden. All I seek to do is give the past a voice. The past never leaves us, but some voices are given a louder say than other. Their whole family only ever paid attention to Eric’s side of the story. They were trapped in his story, incapable of escaping it. Their family was already doing violence to the dead with their obsession. Luke just did what naturally followed from it.” Star’s voice hardened. “But he has to see that other people in that story had a point of view, too. His family objectified Laura and Maria. They were mere things in the story who lacked thoughts and interests of their own. All I want to do is force him to see her as a person. Beyond that, whatever happens is up to Maria and Jessie.”</p>
<p>Silvia nodded. She was silent for a good minute before she spoke. “I don’t want to be a part of the sort of judgment I heard about in church. I know you’re friends with Father Aaron and I assume he’s never treated you badly, but his world is exactly the one I escaped. If you had been planning on casting judgment on Luke, on punishing him for his sins, I wouldn’t leave my apartment to help you.”</p>
<p>Silvia said that as a statement of fact without malice. Star thought on this for a moment. “If I were going to punish him, I wouldn’t want you to come. I wouldn’t want to go. That sort of punishment is for wrathful gods, not for witches or shamans. My role in this is only as a facilitator, as a mouthpiece.”</p>
<p>Silvia flicked her cigarette out onto the gravel below. “Come on. Let’s go.” She turned and left.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, Star tossed their own cigarette and followed. Silvia’s legs were longer than their own, she loomed over them, so it was a struggle to catch up. But, eventually, they were on the back of her bike, again. And they drove off toward the house, toward the night, and toward the final confrontation with the killer.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dusk was creeping when they arrived. Zee was already there, though it would be easy to miss em where e’d set up in the deepening shadows of the house. E took up position beside Star and Laura.</p>
<p>Zee grinned. “Took you long enough to show up.”</p>
<p>“We had to prepare before we came here," Star said.</p>
<p>Together the three of them went up the stairs and opened the door to enter, not bothering to knock, Jessie had said that would be alright. Together they traversed the house to the scene of the murder. Star already felt the presence of Maria in the room and they nodded to her.</p>
<p>Once inside, they unrolled their mat from home.</p>
<p>“We need to draw this pattern on the floor," Star said. "It should cover most of the room and leave enough space to line candles around it. Please be exact with this.”</p>
<p>They weren’t sure how necessary it would all be, but they wanted extra power to their magic just in case. They worked on adding extra sigils to the design as Silvia and Zee put down the base pattern. Once it was all drawn, they placed the candles carefully. A total of twenty around the large circle. The candles formed four interlocking pentagrams.</p>
<p>Before too long it was all set up. They were ready for the ritual. All that needed to happen was for everyone to arrive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Jessie and Luke arrived just before sundown.</p>
<p>Luke was a bit disheveled, like he hadn’t been taking care of himself. He looked around at the whole set up with concern. “What is all this, Jessie?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know or care, Luke. Whatever Star needs to do their work.”</p>
<p>She glared at him and he shut up.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for any hostility from either of you. I just need your help with this séance. I hope Jessie filled you in on what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Luke nodded sullenly.</p>
<p>“Good," Star said. "My assistants will be waiting just outside of the room and I’ll need you to sit...”</p>
<p>They helped direct Luke and Jessie to the best points on the circle for them to sit, so that all three of them would be on the same pentagram and Silvia and Zee left the room.</p>
<p>“I’m going to be summoning a spirit into my body. Give the ghost a chance to speak. We live in a world haunted by the past. The two of you would know this better than most.”</p>
<p>They looked at the two of them in turn.</p>
<p>“Stories of the past carry a power within them," Star continued. "They present a point of view, and one that can be skewed. And, when it is skewed, it is necessary for others from the past to speak, to provide other points of view.”</p>
<p>The two siblings stared at them waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p>“Also," Star said, "I may have lied to the two of you a bit. An exchange for the lies, half truths, and omissions both of you supplied me. Laura, your ancestor, is dead and gone. Her ghost was destroyed in an exorcism. Both of you already know who did it, even as you refuse to admit it. But that’s ok. I have my own witness who was there.”</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">They tilted back their head. The breathed in the air and closed their eyes.</span></p>
<p>"MARIA!"</p>
<p>Their voice echoed out, somehow louder than their vocal chords could make. The fires on the candles flickered as wind swirled around them.</p>
<p>"MARIA!"</p>
<p>They were Maria. This time it was less disorienting. They could feel Star sharing this body with them. They looked out at the two sitting there. Anger grew inside them, but a voice told them that it wasn’t necessary. Not yet.</p>
<p>“So this is what remains of the Winthrop family. The family I served. The family that murdered me for being in love. The family which continued to murder me with every passing generation by speaking lies about me and my beloved. The family which wouldn’t even allow my Laura to rest in peace and killed her a second time. A double betrayal.”</p>
<p>Jessie and Luke stared at them. Silence hung in the air for a few moments.</p>
<p>“What the hell is going on?” Luke asked.</p>
<p>“MURDERER!” screamed Maria from Star’s body. The wind whipped up around them as they did. They rose, both staring at Luke with their eyes, a burning fire within them and tears streaming down their face. Their voice was steadier now. “We were silenced repeatedly. First by Eric who, in his rage, murdered us. Second by your family’s lies. And third when Laura’s ghost was destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Maria..." Jessie said. "I’m so sorry...”</p>
<p>Maria in Star’s body turned to her. “Jessie. You of all people are least worthy of my anger. You remind me of Laura. Like you, she was afraid. Afraid of people knowing who she was, what she wanted. Afraid of your family and how similar you are to Laura. You are as infected by the pathology of your entire family. But you are hurt by it more than you hurt others with it.”</p>
<p>“What do you want of us?” Luke’s voice shook. He hadn’t expected this.</p>
<p>“I want you to shut up and listen. Both of you.” Both of them looked down, almost sullen. “You both know Eric’s story. But you do not know mine or Laura’s. That changes tonight.”</p>
<p>They moved to the center of the circle.</p>
<p>“My family was hired by Eric's father when I was young, when he was young. Before I was old enough to clean, to cook, to work, I played with him as children. We were like family.” They continued walking forward until they stood at the circle’s edge between Luke and Jessie. Luke looked away. "At least back then. His father was a railroad magnate and he inherited the company. It was a lot for him to handle, but he struggled, he worked hard. But, in his struggles, he lost the joy he had as a kid. He learned to fight for dominance, to crack down on his lessers, to destroy his competitors, and so on and so forth.”</p>
<p>They stalked around the circle, barely looking at who they were speaking to.</p>
<p>“That’s when he met Laura. Her family wasn’t rich, but they weren’t poor. And they were social climbers. They wanted his money, and he wanted Laura. I remember the first time she came around. She was nervous, and accompanied by her family. They were the ones who really wanted to be here. They stared at everything in wonder, and greed. Laura stared at nothing. But I couldn't keep my eyes off her. It wasn’t until her third time coming that I caught her eyes. She had come to a backroom to hide. She was so scared by everything and I found her there. I comforted her. We talked for hours until she was willing to go back to her family, to Eric.”</p>
<p>Jessie looked down, frowning. She fiddled with her pen in her lap.</p>
<p>“They were married by the end of the year. Eric paid for everything. Laura’s family got a hefty dowry and Eric bought them a house. They were happy with the arrangement. Laura was not. We met again in the backroom on her wedding night. She sobbed. We’d met there many times and she was never happy with her life. Never happy with Eric.”</p>
<p>They stopped to stare at Luke. He flinched and they said, “The wedding had never been her idea, her choice. Eric had robbed her of her life.</p>
<p>“We grew close. Grew to love each other. We kissed the first time just over a year after their wedding. I knew she couldn’t leave him. It simply wasn’t an option. And she knew that, too. But we used to fantasize about running away together. Maybe to Europe. Or Asia.”</p>
<p>Their cheeks were wet with tears. They stopped speaking for a bit. Luke opened his mouth, but Jessie shushed him. She was crying.</p>
<p>They said, “Somewhere Eric couldn’t touch us. We never did that. She had a kid with him. She wanted to abort him. She resented that Eric wanted this of her. But, when she met the baby, she couldn’t help but love him. He wasn’t his father. He didn’t have his father’s cruelty. At least not yet. It was only a few years after that when Eric discovered us.”</p>
<p>They finally sat back down at the seat they had started at.</p>
<p>“He had suspected that she was seeing someone for years, but he could never prove it. He grew paranoid over this, over the possibility that Laura would find an escape from him. He fired so many servants in his paranoia. But he never suspected me. That is, until he walked in on us in the backroom. In this room. He screamed and yelled. And he smashed our heads against the bed post. His anger took over.” Their voice was shaking. Hard to control.</p>
<p>“But we weren’t over. In our violent end, we manifested again as ghosts. We watched him as he sobbed over our bodies. He begged God for forgiveness, but heard no answer. He’d blame us for what he’d done one minute, then apologize to us the next. He didn’t hate us. But he did hate himself. He hated what we had done. He hated what he had turned into. He hid our bodies, tossed them in a river, and bribed the cops to not investigate. He didn’t even need to bribe them for me. And he only ever told two people what he’d done: A priest and his son.”</p>
<p>They stared daggers at Luke. He whimpered.</p>
<p>Their voice grew weaker. Cracked and tired. “His son took his action up as an obsession. He told his wife. He told his children. He stripped out all of Eric’s doubt, all of Eric’s conflict, and told the story as a struggle between good and evil. I watched as it festered within the family. As they used it to justify all sorts of horrors. Disowning people for sex out of wedlock. Screaming at people for divorce. Even as times changed, and the family changed with the times, the story stuck around as a pathology. Anger and hate, not directed outwards at the world, but inwards toward themselves. And, eventually, it came down to the two of you. You both moved out. But Luke broke in here and performed an exorcism. He murdered Laura a second time. Finally the anger and hate boiled over and turned on the past.”</p>
<p>Luke stared in horror. For a few seconds they were frozen in place. The story had enraptured them. It was their pathology laid bare, their family’s myth stripped down and destroyed. In a flash of movement, Luke scrambled for the door and opened it. Silvia blocked his way.</p>
<p>Silvia extended her telescopic baton with a grin.</p>
<p>“Show them what you found, Zee,” Maria said.</p>
<p>Zee grinned and pulled a manila folder out of their jacket pocket. “This was helpfully given to me by the 18th Street Brewery. This contains employment records of one Luke Winthrop. They hired you as a negotiator and had sought to buy this house. Luke thought they’d tear it down and replace it, erase the past. But they never intended that. They wanted to use the building itself. But Luke hadn’t worked. His contributions didn’t convince Jessie to sell the house. So they fired him last week. I presume that’s when you hatched your plan to break in.” Zee pulled out another sheet of paper. “Oh, and this here is testimony helpfully provided to me by Father O’Connor telling me a young man had approached him to ask him about how to perform an exorcism. I presume that was you.”</p>
<p>Luke simply stared at them, then to the ground. He slumped against the wall by the door. He looked broken. Finally he spoke, “This changes nothing. You and Laura still betrayed Eric. It doesn’t matter if she was unhappy. She had made a promise.”</p>
<p>“It was a promise made under duress.” Maria spoke with a harsh voice. “Her family forced her to promise her life to someone. It was their promise, not hers. And her family certainly broke their promise. Not with what she did with me. They had promised him that she would be his. That she’d want him. She’d choose to be with him. None of that was ever true. It was never her choice, nor her desire. She was never his.”</p>
<p>Luke opened his mouth to speak, but closed it. Instead he stared at his feet. He was in shock.</p>
<p>“We are both shaped by our family’s past.” Jessie’s voice was soft, kind. “I kept as much hate within me as you did. I hated myself for who I was. And we can never escape that past. But we can find a new way to relate to it. We can see things from more perspectives than Eric’s.”</p>
<p>Luke slumped against the wall.</p>
<p>Jessie looked at everyone else. “This is a family matter. I would please ask you all to leave. You may stay Maria, but you may not, Star.”</p>
<hr>
<p>They were Star once more. Outside of the room, they slumped against the wall. Zee and Silvia helped stabilize them.</p>
<p>“You look exhausted.” Silvia’s voice was filled with concern.</p>
<p>“I am exhausted. Things were intense. Maria’s anger was consuming.” They rested between Zee and Silvia’s arms for a moment. “Thank you. Both of you. For being here with me. You helped.”</p>
<p>Silvia smiled at them. “It’s no problem. We are friends.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, totes," Zee added. "I’d never miss a chance to help you.”</p>
<p>Star stared at the door. “I wonder what they’re talking about in there.”</p>
<p>“It’s quiet," Zee said. "So they can’t be fighting. Not with any yelling, at least.”</p>
<p>“I guess we’ll find out when they emerge,” Silvia said.</p>
<p>More time passed. No one came out. Star broke the silence first. “Once this is all over, do the two of you want to come back to my place? Have some pizza, drink some alcohol, spend time together?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” The two of them answered. They laughed and, after a few moments, Star joined in.</p>
<p>The door opened. Luke was crying and Jessie’s face was stained with tears as well. She took a few moments to collect herself and no one dared to push her.</p>
<p>“Luke and I will need to start seeing a family therapist together," Jessie said. "We have a lot to work through. This is only a start.”</p>
<p>Star nodded.</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“It wouldn't be right for me or Luke to do this. Not after all we’ve done. Our family has done. But could you set up a memorial for Laura? Not right now. But in here. You have full access to the house to do it when you have the chance.”</p>
<p>Star nodded. “I would be happy to.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” She started to turn back into the room, then stopped. “Oh, I suppose I should pay you.” She handed Star an envelope of money.</p>
<p>Star bowed their head slightly, a gesture Jessie returned. Then she returned to the room.</p>
